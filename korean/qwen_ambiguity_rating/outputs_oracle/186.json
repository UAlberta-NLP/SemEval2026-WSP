  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: flop\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. fall loosely (e.g., \"She flopped onto the soft couch.\")\n2. fail utterly; collapse (e.g., \"The presentation was a complete flop.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jason trained for months at the local pool. He perfected his moves and gained confidence. He felt ready to impress the judges at the big event.\nSentence containing the homonym: Despite all his practice, his dive at the competition was a flop.\nEnding: He intended it to be much more controlled.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Flop\" as a fall loosely does not fit, as the context describes a dive performance, not a physical collapse onto a couch.  \n• \"Flop\" as a total failure makes sense given the precontext: Jason trained extensively and intended a controlled dive, but it failed dramatically.  \n• The ending (\"He intended it to be much more controlled\") strongly supports the idea of failure, not a physical fall, ruling out the first meaning.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
