  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: rare\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (of meat) cooked a short time; still red inside (e.g., \"I prefer my steak cooked rare.\")\n2. recurring only at long intervals (e.g., \"A rare comet will pass by soon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: James walked into the old butcher shop, eyeing the selection carefully. He remembered the legend of a steak so unique it could only be found once in a blue moon. The shopkeeper smiled, sensing James's curiosity as he pointed out a special cut.\nSentence containing the homonym: Well, this particular steak has to be rare.\nEnding: James understood then that this wasn't just about how the steak was cooked, but about the exceptional quality that made it a truly infrequent find.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext explicitly mentions a \"steak so unique it could only be found once in a blue moon,\" strongly aligning with the rare meaning as \"infrequent\" rather than \"cooked a short time.\"  \n• The sentence \"this particular steak has to be rare\" follows naturally from the butcher shop setting and the legend of a unique cut, supporting the interpretation of \"rare\" as infrequent.  \n• The ending clarifies that the rarity refers to exceptional quality and infrequency, not cooking method, confirming the non-cooking meaning and ruling out the culinary sense.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
