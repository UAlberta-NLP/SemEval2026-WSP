  "explanation": "• The precontext emphasizes \"unusual\" flavors and \"extraordinary dishes,\" making a culinary meaning of \"rare\" (as in rare meat) highly plausible.  \n• The sentence \"He had waited a long time to have this rare beef\" directly refers to a type of meat, and the ending describes the beef's internal state as red and glistening, which aligns with the culinary definition.  \n• The second meaning (\"rare\" as in infrequent events) does not fit, as the context is about a specific dish, not an infrequent celestial or natural phenomenon.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: rare\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (of meat) cooked a short time; still red inside (e.g., \"I prefer my steak cooked rare.\")\n2. recurring only at long intervals (e.g., \"A rare comet will pass by soon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jack had always dreamed of tasting something unusual. He spent years traveling to distant lands for unique flavors. Finally, he found himself sitting in a renowned restaurant known for its extraordinary dishes.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had waited a long time to have this rare beef.\nEnding: He cut into the beef, the inside red and glistening.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes \"unusual\" flavors and \"extraordinary dishes,\" making a culinary meaning of \"rare\" (as in rare meat) highly plausible.  \n• The sentence \"He had waited a long time to have this rare beef\" directly refers to a type of meat, and the ending describes the beef's internal state as red and glistening, which aligns with the culinary definition.  \n• The second meaning (\"rare\" as in infrequent events) does not fit, as the context is about a specific dish, not an infrequent celestial or natural phenomenon.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
