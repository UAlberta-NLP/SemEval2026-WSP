  "explanation": "• The precontext involving a butcher shop and a \"special cut\" strongly supports the culinary meaning of \"rare\" as cooked meat.  \n• The mention of a \"legend of a steak so unique it could only be found once in a blue moon\" aligns with the rare meaning as \"uncommon,\" but this refers to scarcity, not cooking style.  \n• The ending stating that the steak's price increases due to its rarity in supply supports the culinary interpretation, as \"rare\" in meat context is a quality, not a frequency.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: rare\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (of meat) cooked a short time; still red inside (e.g., \"I prefer my steak cooked rare.\")\n2. recurring only at long intervals (e.g., \"A rare comet will pass by soon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: James walked into the old butcher shop, eyeing the selection carefully. He remembered the legend of a steak so unique it could only be found once in a blue moon. The shopkeeper smiled, sensing James's curiosity as he pointed out a special cut.\nSentence containing the homonym: Well, this particular steak has to be rare.\nEnding: This would automatically increase its price.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext involving a butcher shop and a \"special cut\" strongly supports the culinary meaning of \"rare\" as cooked meat.  \n• The mention of a \"legend of a steak so unique it could only be found once in a blue moon\" aligns with the rare meaning as \"uncommon,\" but this refers to scarcity, not cooking style.  \n• The ending stating that the steak's price increases due to its rarity in supply supports the culinary interpretation, as \"rare\" in meat context is a quality, not a frequency.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
