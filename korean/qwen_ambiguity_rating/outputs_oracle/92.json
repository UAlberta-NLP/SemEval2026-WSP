They both needed time away from the hustle of the city. After packing their bags, they were finally on their way.\nSentence containing the homonym: The couple went to their reservation.\nEnding: It was a very comfortable three-bedroom apartment; they were glad they booked some additional space.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (a district reserved for a purpose) is implausible because the context describes a couple traveling to a place, not visiting a tribal or geographic reservation.  \n• Meaning 2 (the act of reserving a place or service) is supported by the precontext and ending, which mention booking additional space, indicating a booking or reservation of accommodation.  \n• The ending explicitly confirms \"booked some additional space,\" which aligns with the act of reserving a place, making this meaning clearly dominant.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
