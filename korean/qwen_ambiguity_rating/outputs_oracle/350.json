  "explanation": "• The mention of a \"peach\" in a market setting, surrounded by colorful stalls and visual sights, strongly suggests a fruit, as visual appeal is a common feature of such contexts.  \n• The phrase \"That peach over there is grabbing her attention\" describes a person, not a fruit, and the use of \"grabbing her attention\" aligns with the figurative sense of a seductive woman.  \n• The ending explicitly praises the woman's hair and describes her as \"the most beautiful sight,\" which supports the interpretation of \"peach\" as a woman, not a fruit.",

Her gaze drifted, catching various things and people.\nSentence containing the homonym: That peach over there is grabbing her attention.\nEnding: The woman's hair flowing freely down her back was the most beautiful sight.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The mention of a \"peach\" in a market setting, surrounded by colorful stalls and visual sights, strongly suggests a fruit, as visual appeal is a common feature of such contexts.  \n• The phrase \"That peach over there is grabbing her attention\" describes a person, not a fruit, and the use of \"grabbing her attention\" aligns with the figurative sense of a seductive woman.  \n• The ending explicitly praises the woman's hair and describes her as \"the most beautiful sight,\" which supports the interpretation of \"peach\" as a woman, not a fruit.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
