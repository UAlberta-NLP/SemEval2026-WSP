  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: hops\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. twining perennials having cordate leaves and flowers arranged in conelike spikes; the dried flowers of this plant are used in brewing to add the characteristic bitter taste to beer (e.g., \"The brewer selected fresh hops for flavor.\")\n2. the act of hopping; jumping upward or forward (especially on one foot) (e.g., \"The frog made a quick hop.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Ana loved her garden. She spent hours planting different kinds of seeds. Every day, she would practice her jumps over the small fence.\nSentence containing the homonym: Ana had lots of hops.\nEnding: They were the most beautiful flowers.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext about Ana loving her garden and planting seeds strongly suggests a connection to plants, making the botanical meaning of \"hops\" plausible.  \n• The prior mention of Ana practicing jumps over a fence supports the interpretation of \"hops\" as the act of jumping, especially given the physical activity described.  \n• The ending stating \"They were the most beautiful flowers\" directly confirms that \"hops\" refers to the plant, as it describes flowers, ruling out the act of jumping.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
