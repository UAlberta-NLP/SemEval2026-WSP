  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: draw\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. bring, take, or pull out of a container or from under a cover (e.g., \"He will draw a knife swiftly.\")\n2. represent by making a drawing of, as with a pencil, chalk, etc. on a surface (e.g., \"She will draw a beautiful landscape.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Mark reached into his backpack and felt around. He found the small object he'd been searching for. A smile spread across his face as he imagined its potential.\nSentence containing the homonym: Mark believed he could draw it very quickly.\nEnding: He quickly dipped the tip into the large paper, waiting on the table beside him.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Draw\" meaning \"bring out of a container\" is strongly supported by the precontext (Mark reaching into his backpack and finding an object), and the phrase \"he could draw it very quickly\" fits naturally with retrieving something.  \n• \"Draw\" meaning \"make a drawing\" is plausible but less supported; the ending mentions dipping a tip into paper, which suggests drawing as in art, but this occurs after the belief about drawing the object, making it a separate action.  \n• The sequence shows a shift: first, drawing (retrieving) an object, then drawing (making a drawing) on paper—yet the timing and context suggest the first meaning is primary and the second is a secondary, distinct action.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
