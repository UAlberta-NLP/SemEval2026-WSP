  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: bank\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water) (e.g., \"The children played near the riverbank.\")\n2. a building in which the business of banking transacted (e.g., \"She visited the bank to deposit money.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: They had planned to meet after a long time. She promised to be there around noon. He checked his watch nervously, eager to see her again.\nSentence containing the homonym: He would wait for her near the bank.\nEnding: He made sure he stood near the door so he could be seen.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions a meeting and a person waiting near a location, making \"bank\" as a place to meet (meaning 2) highly plausible.  \n• \"Bank\" as a riverbank (meaning 1) would be geographically static and less likely in a context involving a meeting and someone waiting near a door.  \n• The ending specifies \"near the door,\" which supports a building (bank as in financial institution) rather than a natural feature like a riverbank.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
