  "explanation": "• The phrase \"small tips\" in the context of kids crafting paper airplanes is more likely to refer to the physical ends or points of the paper airplanes, given the mention of \"folding the edges\" and \"paper airplanes\"  \n• The meaning of \"small tips\" as in small amounts of money is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of service, payment, or a barista receiving money  \n• The precontext emphasizes physical objects (flowers, paper airplanes) and actions involving folding and shaping, which supports a literal interpretation of \"tip\" as a physical point",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: tips\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the extreme end of something; especially something pointed (e.g., \"The tip of the spear glimmered.\")\n2. a relatively small amount of money given for services rendered (as by a waiter) (e.g., \"I left a generous tip for dinner.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Anna walked into the small cafe, admiring its cozy decorations. She noticed the barista arranging flowers on the tables. Nearby, a group of kids was crafting paper airplanes, giggling as they carefully folded the edges.\nSentence containing the homonym: Those are some small tips over there.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"small tips\" in the context of kids crafting paper airplanes is more likely to refer to the physical ends or points of the paper airplanes, given the mention of \"folding the edges\" and \"paper airplanes\"  \n• The meaning of \"small tips\" as in small amounts of money is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of service, payment, or a barista receiving money  \n• The precontext emphasizes physical objects (flowers, paper airplanes) and actions involving folding and shaping, which supports a literal interpretation of \"tip\" as a physical point  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
