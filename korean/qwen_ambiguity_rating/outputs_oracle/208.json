  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: Drawing\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. make a mark or lines on a surface (e.g., \"Please draw a circle on the paper.\")\n2. take liquid out of a container or well; (e.g., \"She will draw water from the well.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emma loved spending time at the old cottage in the countryside. Her mornings were filled with tasks around the house. She often found herself at the well or sitting with her sketchbook by the window.\nSentence containing the homonym: Drawing water can be quite difficult.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Drawing water\" is a common and plausible activity in the countryside setting, supported by the precontext mentioning Emma being at the well.  \n• The precontext mentions Emma sitting with her sketchbook, suggesting artistic activity, but the sentence \"Drawing water\" does not logically connect to sketching in this case.  \n• The phrase \"drawing water\" as a verb meaning \"to take water\" is idiomatic and contextually grounded in rural domestic tasks, while \"drawing\" as in making a line is not supported by the surrounding actions.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
