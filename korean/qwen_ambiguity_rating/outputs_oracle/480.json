  "explanation": "• The phrase \"there was no point\" in the context of bringing a knife and forgetting food strongly suggests a lack of purpose or utility, aligning with meaning 1 (the object of an activity).  \n• Meaning 2 (sharp end) is unlikely because the sentence does not refer to a physical object being missing, and there is no mention of a blade or tool with a point.  \n• The ending, \"He had forgotten the food, so what would he cut?\" reinforces that the missing item is functional (a purpose), not a physical part of a tool.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: point\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the object of an activity (e.g., \"What is the point of this meeting?\")\n2. sharp end (e.g., \"He carefully carved the point of the stick.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jack was nervous about the camping trip. He remembered the tales of wild animals in the woods. His friends insisted everyone bring only the essentials.\nSentence containing the homonym: He did bring a knife, but there was no point.\nEnding: He had forgotten the food, so what would he cut?\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"there was no point\" in the context of bringing a knife and forgetting food strongly suggests a lack of purpose or utility, aligning with meaning 1 (the object of an activity).  \n• Meaning 2 (sharp end) is unlikely because the sentence does not refer to a physical object being missing, and there is no mention of a blade or tool with a point.  \n• The ending, \"He had forgotten the food, so what would he cut?\" reinforces that the missing item is functional (a purpose), not a physical part of a tool.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
