  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: stars\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (astronomy) a celestial body of hot gases that radiates energy derived from thermonuclear reactions in the interior (e.g., \"The star shone brightly in the sky.\")\n2. an actor who plays a principal role (e.g., \"The star delivered an outstanding performance.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom had spent months planning his special trip. He packed his bags, making sure to include his telescope and binoculars. As the day approached, his excitement grew with every passing hour.\nSentence containing the homonym: He looked forward to seeing the stars.\nEnding: He couldn't wait to look up and see all the lights glimmering.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Tom packing a telescope and binoculars, strongly suggesting an astronomical context where \"stars\" refers to celestial bodies.  \n• The sentence \"He looked forward to seeing the stars\" follows naturally from the prior mention of astronomical equipment, making the celestial meaning highly plausible.  \n• The ending describes \"all the lights glimmering,\" which aligns with city lights rather than celestial stars, indicating a potential shift in meaning—but this still refers to lights in the sky, not actors.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
