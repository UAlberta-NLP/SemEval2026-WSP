  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: point\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a brief version of the essential meaning of something (e.g., \"Make your point clearly and concisely.\")\n2. sharp end (e.g., \"He carefully carved the point of the stick.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom was deep in thought as he faced the cluttered shelf. On it, there lay a map rolled up beside an old hunting knife. He knew he had to make his decision now.\nSentence containing the homonym: He got to the point.\nEnding: Unfurling the map, he traced a finger along the coastline until he found what he was looking for. \"There! That's where we'll go fishing.\" And with that, he pocketed the knife and ran out the door, down to the boatshed where everyone was waiting.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Make your point clearly\" fits naturally in the context of Tom making a decision about where to go fishing, suggesting a meaning related to conveying an idea.  \n• \"Sharp end\" of a knife is inconsistent with the sentence \"He got to the point\" in this context, as the knife is already mentioned and the action involves decision-making, not physical manipulation of the knife's tip.  \n• The precontext and ending show Tom making a decision, which aligns with the idea of \"getting to the point\" as in arriving at a conclusion, not physically accessing the knife's point.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
