She promised to be there around noon. He checked his watch nervously, eager to see her again.\nSentence containing the homonym: He would wait for her near the bank.\nEnding: She finally arrived, and they sat on a nearby bench watching the water.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a meeting and a nervous wait, suggesting a physical location where someone might meet, making \"bank\" as in a riverbank plausible.  \n• \"Bank\" as a financial institution is unlikely here because no mention of money, transactions, or financial activity occurs in the context.  \n• The ending mentions \"watching the water\" and a \"bench near the bank,\" which strongly supports a natural landscape feature (riverbank) rather than a building.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
