  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fiddling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. avoid (one's assigned duties) (e.g., \"He decided to fiddle with his responsibilities.\")\n2. play the violin or fiddle (e.g., \"She loves to fiddle at night.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The meeting started promptly at nine. Everyone in the room was expected to contribute. Yet, some were clearly distracted.\nSentence containing the homonym: Can they stop fiddling? It's really irritating and annoying.\nEnding: As the discussion continued, their constant movements and distractions became increasingly frustrating for those trying to focus.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Fiddling\" as avoiding duties fits the context of distraction and lack of contribution during a meeting.  \n• \"Fiddling\" as playing the violin is inconsistent with the context of people being distracted and making movements during a discussion.  \n• The ending describing \"constant movements and distractions\" strongly supports the interpretation of \"fiddling\" as avoiding responsibilities, not playing an instrument.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
