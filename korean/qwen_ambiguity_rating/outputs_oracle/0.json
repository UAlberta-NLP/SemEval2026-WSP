They were looking for signs of the missing artifact. A faint trail caught their attention.\nSentence containing the homonym: They followed the track.\nEnding: They began to run along the abandoned railway line, hopping from wooden sleeper to sleeper to avoid twisting an ankle.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions \"signs of the missing artifact\" and \"a faint trail,\" which strongly supports \"track\" as evidence or a trail of clues.  \n• The sentence \"They followed the track\" logically continues the idea of following a trail, consistent with meaning #2 (evidence/trail).  \n• The ending explicitly references \"the abandoned railway line,\" confirming the physical railway track (meaning #1), which suggests the homonym is used in both senses but the core action is physical movement along rails.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
