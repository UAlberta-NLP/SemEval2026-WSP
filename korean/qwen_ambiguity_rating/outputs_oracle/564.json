  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: trailer\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an advertisement consisting of short scenes from a motion picture that will appear in the near future (e.g., \"I watched the new movie trailer online.\")\n2. a wheeled vehicle that can be pulled by a car or truck and is equipped for occupancy (e.g., \"They traveled cross-country in their trailer.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Mark eagerly waited by the curb, scanning the street for any sign of movement. He had heard rumors about something exciting being nearby, and his curiosity was piqued. His friend mentioned that it would be worth seeing, sparking his imagination with endless possibilities.\nSentence containing the homonym: That trailer is good to look at.\nEnding: As the trailer played on the big screen outside the theater, Mark couldn’t help but smile, excited for the movie to finally come out.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Mark waiting for a movie to arrive, with a focus on excitement and anticipation, which strongly supports the \"advertisement\" meaning of trailer.  \n• The sentence \"That trailer is good to look at\" is used in a visual, cinematic context, aligning with the meaning of a movie trailer as a promotional video.  \n• The ending explicitly references \"the trailer played on the big screen outside the theater,\" confirming the promotional/advertisement meaning and ruling out the vehicle interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
