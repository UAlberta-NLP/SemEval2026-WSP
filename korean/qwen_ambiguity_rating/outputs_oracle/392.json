  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pick\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. select carefully from a group (e.g., \"She had to pick a winner.\")\n2. harass with constant criticism (e.g., \"Stop picking on your classmates.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Harry loved working in the garden, his hands always busy among the flowers. Over the years, he had developed a reputation for having an eye for the best blooms. However, his friends sometimes joked about how picky he could be with everything in life.\nSentence containing the homonym: Harry had a bad tendency to pick without discernment or discrimination.\nEnding: He didn't mind going out of his way to help his friends resolve a conflict.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Pick\" as \"select carefully\" fits well with the precontext of Harry having an eye for the best blooms and being selective about things.  \n• \"Pick\" as \"harass with criticism\" is inconsistent with the context, as there is no indication of Harry being critical or bullying others; the friends' joke about him being \"picky\" already suggests selectivity, not harassment.  \n• The sentence \"had a bad tendency to pick without discernment\" contradicts the idea of careful selection, making the \"select\" meaning seem illogical under this usage, while the \"harass\" meaning would not align with the garden or conflict-resolution context.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
