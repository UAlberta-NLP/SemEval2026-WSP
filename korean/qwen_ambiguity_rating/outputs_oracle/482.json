He remembered the tales of wild animals in the woods. His friends insisted everyone bring only the essentials.\nSentence containing the homonym: He did bring a knife, but there was no point.\nEnding: It was blunt.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"there was no point\" in the context of bringing camping gear strongly suggests the meaning \"the object or purpose\" (meaning 1), as it refers to whether something has a purpose or utility.  \n• The meaning \"sharp end\" (meaning 2) is implausible here, as a knife’s sharp end is not being discussed, and the sentence does not refer to physical objects being missing or blunt.  \n• The ending \"It was blunt\" reinforces the interpretation of the knife’s edge being blunt, which directly supports the physical \"point\" meaning (2), but only if \"point\" refers to the knife’s tip — yet this contradicts the earlier \"no point\" meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
