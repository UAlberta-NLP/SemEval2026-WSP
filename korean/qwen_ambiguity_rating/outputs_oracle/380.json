  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: vision\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the ability to see; the visual faculty (e.g., \"Her vision is clearer with glasses.\")\n2. the formation of a mental image of something that is not perceived as real and is not present to the senses (e.g., \"Her vision of the future inspired everyone.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: \nAlex woke up to a bright light flooding his room. He rubbed his eyes, trying to make sense of the strange shapes and colors. The images danced before him, indistinct and puzzling.\nSentence containing the homonym: Alex found it hard to clear his vision.\nEnding: Sitting up, Alex told himself he must try to block out the unnecessary thoughts.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Alex seeing strange shapes and colors, suggesting a physical visual experience, making the sensory meaning of \"vision\" highly plausible.  \n• The sentence \"Alex found it hard to clear his vision\" directly follows a description of visual confusion, indicating difficulty with visual perception, not mental imagery.  \n• The ending mentions blocking \"unnecessary thoughts,\" which does not support a mental image interpretation, further ruling out the second meaning.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
