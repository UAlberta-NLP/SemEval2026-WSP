She felt a mix of excitement and apprehension as she prepared for the procedure. Her mentor assured her that she was ready for the challenge ahead.\nSentence containing the homonym: The surgeon said the patient had guts like she'd never seen before.\nEnding: She was really brave.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (fortitude) is strongly supported by the precontext and ending, which emphasize bravery and emotional courage.  \n• Meaning 2 (anatomical part) is irrelevant in this context, as the sentence discusses emotional bravery, not physical anatomy.  \n• The phrase \"guts like she'd never seen before\" is a common idiomatic expression for courage, not a medical description.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
