  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: logs\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a segment of the trunk of a tree when stripped of branches (e.g., \"The firewood was made from a log.\")\n2. a written record of messages sent or received (e.g., \"Please update the log daily.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John had been working at the warehouse for several months. He was in charge of keeping everything in order. Recently, there had been some confusion about inventory.\nSentence containing the homonym: Some wood had gone missing from the warehouse, and John was desperately trying to locate the logs.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions inventory confusion and missing wood, making \"logs\" as in tree trunks highly plausible.  \n• \"Logs\" as a record of messages does not fit the context of missing physical wood or inventory management.  \n• The phrase \"wood had gone missing\" strongly supports the physical object meaning, as \"wood\" and \"logs\" are directly linked in material inventory.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
