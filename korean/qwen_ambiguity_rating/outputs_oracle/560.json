They planned to test the resilience of certain variables under stress. As the trial began, everyone was eager to observe the outcomes.\nSentence containing the homonym: The identities did not change, given the circumstances.\nEnding: However, multiple other changes were observed.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The context discusses variables and their resilience under stress, suggesting a focus on measurable, unchanging properties—aligning with meaning 2 (mathematical identity).  \n• Meaning 1 (personal identity) would be out of place, as the sentence refers to \"variables\" and \"circumstances,\" not individuals or personal traits.  \n• The phrase \"the identities did not change\" in a scientific experiment setting strongly implies invariance in values or states, not personal characteristics.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
