  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: flexible\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. capable of being changed (e.g., \"She has a flexible work schedule.\")\n2. able to flex; able to bend easily (e.g., \"The flexible branches swayed in the breeze.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Mark and Lisa both enjoy staying active. They have different schedules each week. Sometimes they rearrange their plans to work out together.\nSentence containing the homonym: They are quite flexible when going to the gym.\nEnding: They both work remotely and take their own breaks.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (capable of being changed) is strongly supported by the precontext, as both individuals rearrange their plans to work out together, indicating adaptability in scheduling.  \n• Meaning 2 (able to bend easily) is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of physical objects or body parts bending, and the context focuses on schedule adjustments, not physical flexibility.  \n• The ending reinforces the schedule-related interpretation, confirming that \"flexible\" refers to adaptable plans rather than physical ability.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
