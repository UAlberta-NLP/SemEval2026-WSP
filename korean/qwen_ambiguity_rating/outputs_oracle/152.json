  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fallout\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the radioactive particles that settle to the ground after a nuclear explosion (e.g., \"The fallout from the explosion contaminated nearby soil.\")\n2. any adverse and unwanted secondary effect (e.g., \"The scandal had significant financial fallout.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The experiment went horribly wrong. A huge plume rose into the sky. People watched from a distance, unsure of the outcome.\nSentence containing the homonym: The fallout was an impressive sight to behold.\nEnding: Loads of dust surrounded the sky.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describing a nuclear explosion with a \"huge plume\" rising into the sky strongly supports the radioactive fallout meaning.  \n• The sentence \"The fallout was an impressive sight to behold\" fits naturally with visual, physical debris like dust and particles, not abstract consequences.  \n• The ending \"Loads of dust surrounded the sky\" directly confirms the physical, tangible nature of the phenomenon, ruling out the abstract \"adverse effect\" interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
