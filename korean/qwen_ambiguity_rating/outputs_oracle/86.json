  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: star\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (astronomy) a celestial body of hot gases that radiates energy derived from thermonuclear reactions in the interior (e.g., \"The star shone brightly in the sky.\")\n2. an actor who plays a principal role (e.g., \"The star delivered an outstanding performance.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The night sky was full of bright lights. Many gathered in the field with their telescopes and cameras ready. Everyone was hoping for a glimpse of something spectacular.\nSentence containing the homonym: It was clear which one was the outstanding star.\nEnding: When the spotlight hit the lead actress stepping onto the makeshift outdoor set, the entire crew fell silent in admiration.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describing \"bright lights\" in the night sky strongly supports the astronomical meaning of \"star\" as a celestial body.  \n• The phrase \"outstanding star\" in the sentence, combined with the mention of performance and a lead actress, strongly suggests the actor meaning, as \"star\" in this context refers to a prominent performer.  \n• The ending explicitly confirms the actor meaning by referring to \"the lead actress\" and \"spotlight,\" which directly ties \"star\" to the role of a performer, ruling out the astronomical interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
