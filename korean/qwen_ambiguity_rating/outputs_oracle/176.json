  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: hops\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. twining perennials having cordate leaves and flowers arranged in conelike spikes; the dried flowers of this plant are used in brewing to add the characteristic bitter taste to beer (e.g., \"The brewer selected fresh hops for flavor.\")\n2. the act of hopping; jumping upward or forward (especially on one foot) (e.g., \"The frog made a quick hop.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Ana loved her garden. She spent hours planting different kinds of seeds. Every day, she would practice her jumps over the small fence.\nSentence containing the homonym: Ana had lots of hops.\nEnding: The obstacles were not a problem for Ana.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Ana planting seeds and practicing jumps, suggesting a strong connection to physical movement and gardening, making \"hops\" as in the plant plausible in a garden context.  \n• \"Hops\" as in the act of hopping is supported by the prior mention of Ana practicing jumps over a fence, making this meaning contextually consistent with the verb usage.  \n• The sentence \"Ana had lots of hops\" is grammatically and semantically ambiguous: \"lots of hops\" could refer to the plant (a quantity of hops used in brewing) or the action (many hops in movement), but neither is clearly supported by the garden or jump context.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
