  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: blaze\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a strong flame that burns brightly (e.g., \"The blaze illuminated the dark night.\")\n2. a cause of difficulty and suffering (e.g., \"The blaze of war devastated the region.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The dry summer had turned the forest into a tinderbox. A small spark could create chaos. Warnings from the watchtower had echoed through the valley.\nSentence containing the homonym: The blaze could only worsen.\nEnding: Everyone was waiting on edge to see what or who had survived.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a dry forest prone to fire, making \"a strong flame\" the most plausible meaning of \"blaze\"  \n• The sentence \"The blaze could only worsen\" logically follows from a fire spreading in a tinderbox environment  \n• The ending, which focuses on survival after chaos, supports the interpretation of a destructive fire rather than a \"cause of suffering\"  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
