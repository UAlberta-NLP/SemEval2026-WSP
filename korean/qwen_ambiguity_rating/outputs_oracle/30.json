  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: coached\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. teach and supervise (someone); act as a trainer or coach (to), as in sports (e.g., \"The coach trains the players daily.\")\n2. drive a coach (e.g., \"The coach drove us to the game.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom had always loved sports and vintage vehicles. When the team asked for his help, he couldn't refuse. He saw this as an opportunity to combine his two passions.\nSentence containing the homonym: He coached the team all the way to the championship.\nEnding: And after winning, he received an award for the Best Coach.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Tom's passion for both sports and vintage vehicles, and his willingness to help the team, making \"coached the team\" as a trainer highly plausible.  \n• The sentence \"He coached the team all the way to the championship\" clearly follows the pattern of a person training a sports team, which aligns with meaning 1.  \n• The ending explicitly refers to him as \"the Best Coach,\" which confirms the role of a sports trainer and rules out the vehicle-driving interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
