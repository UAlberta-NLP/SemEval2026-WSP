A huge plume rose into the sky. People watched from a distance, unsure of the outcome.\nSentence containing the homonym: The fallout was an impressive sight to behold.\nEnding: First, a bright light, then the shockwave, and outside the blast zone, those downwind had just minutes to escape before the radioactive cloud arrived.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a nuclear explosion with a \"plume\" and \"radioactive cloud,\" strongly supporting the literal scientific meaning of fallout as radioactive particles.  \n• The phrase \"fallout was an impressive sight to behold\" fits naturally with the visual of a radioactive cloud descending, making the literal meaning highly plausible.  \n• The secondary meaning (\"adverse effect\") would imply a consequence like economic or social damage, which is not supported by the visual, dramatic, and physical description of the event.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
