  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fledgling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. any new participant in some activity (e.g., \"The fledgling entrepreneur gained valuable experience.\")\n2. young bird that has just fledged or become capable of flying (e.g., \"The fledgling took its first flight.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The team gathered in the small room. Everyone was curious and a bit nervous. They had been waiting for this moment all week.\nSentence containing the homonym: The fledgling has just arrived.\nEnding: The little bird's first solo flight was a success.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a team gathering, with no mention of birds or animals, making a \"fledgling entrepreneur\" or \"new participant\" more contextually relevant than a young bird.  \n• The sentence \"The fledgling has just arrived\" fits naturally with a person or organization entering a situation, as \"arrived\" aligns with human participants.  \n• The ending mentions \"the little bird's first solo flight,\" which confirms the bird meaning and directly supports the interpretation of \"fledgling\" as a young bird, thus resolving the ambiguity.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
