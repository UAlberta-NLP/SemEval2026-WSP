  "explanation": "• The precontext describes a drive-in movie setting, where \"trailer\" as a movie advertisement fits naturally with the phrase \"looked at the trailer in front of them\" and the mention of \"Prosecco\" suggesting a viewing event.  \n• \"Trailer\" as a vehicle would be inconsistent with the context: vehicles are not typically \"in front of them\" at a drive-in in a way that implies occupancy or movement, and the ending about two ladies drinking Prosecco does not suggest a trailer being used.  \n• The phrase \"trailer in front of them\" at a drive-in strongly aligns with the common usage of \"movie trailer\" as a promotional clip, especially since the sentence follows a sequence of movie-related actions.",

They parked their car at the drive-in's first row for the best view. As the sun set, they settled in with popcorn and drinks.\nSentence containing the homonym: At the drive-in movie, they looked at the trailer in front of them.\nEnding: They could see two ladies drinking Prosecco.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a drive-in movie setting, where \"trailer\" as a movie advertisement fits naturally with the phrase \"looked at the trailer in front of them\" and the mention of \"Prosecco\" suggesting a viewing event.  \n• \"Trailer\" as a vehicle would be inconsistent with the context: vehicles are not typically \"in front of them\" at a drive-in in a way that implies occupancy or movement, and the ending about two ladies drinking Prosecco does not suggest a trailer being used.  \n• The phrase \"trailer in front of them\" at a drive-in strongly aligns with the common usage of \"movie trailer\" as a promotional clip, especially since the sentence follows a sequence of movie-related actions.\n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
