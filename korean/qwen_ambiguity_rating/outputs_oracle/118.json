The distant village promised an adventure they had been seeking for a long time. They discussed the possibility of visiting that mysterious, often discussed place.\nSentence containing the homonym: They had reservations but still continued despite the situation.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes the couple discussing a potential visit to a distant village, suggesting a decision-making scenario involving uncertainty or hesitation.  \n• \"Reservations\" meaning 1 (unstated doubt) fits naturally in a context where people are weighing a decision about visiting a place they've long wanted to explore.  \n• Meaning 2 (booking a place or service) is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of dining, travel arrangements, or making a booking.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
