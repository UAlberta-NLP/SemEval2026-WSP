Everyone was curious and a bit nervous. They had been waiting for this moment all week.\nSentence containing the homonym: The fledgling has just arrived.\nEnding: It was exciting to be introduced to such a new team member who was just beginning their journey with the company, and they were hopeful it would go well.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a team member \"just arrived\" and \"beginning their journey with the company,\" strongly supporting the meaning of a new participant.  \n• The phrase \"fledgling\" referring to a young bird does not fit the context of a human team member arriving at a workplace.  \n• The ending explicitly refers to a \"new team member\" and their \"journey with the company,\" confirming the human participant interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
