  "explanation": "• The phrase \"making a reservation\" in the context of planning to attend a dinner event strongly supports meaning 1 (reserving a place or passage).  \n• Meaning 2 (a statement limiting a claim) is not supported by the sentence structure or the surrounding narrative, which does not involve a conditional or restrictive statement about a proposal.  \n• The ending clarifies that the restaurant didn’t need to be booked in advance, which reinforces that the prior action was about securing a table, not making a conditional statement.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: reservation\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the act of reserving (a place or passage) or engaging the services of (a person or group) (e.g., \"I made a reservation for dinner.\")\n2. a statement that limits or restricts some claim (e.g., \"I support her proposal with no reservations.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Anna hesitated when she saw the message from her coworkers inviting her out. She wasn't sure if she should go because she liked her evenings quiet. They always had a great time together, but she felt a bit overwhelmed.\nSentence containing the homonym: She agreed to join them for the dinner, but only after making a reservation.\nEnding: She told them that the restaurant didn't need to be booked in advance and that her condition was she would only stay for one or two hours.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"making a reservation\" in the context of planning to attend a dinner event strongly supports meaning 1 (reserving a place or passage).  \n• Meaning 2 (a statement limiting a claim) is not supported by the sentence structure or the surrounding narrative, which does not involve a conditional or restrictive statement about a proposal.  \n• The ending clarifies that the restaurant didn’t need to be booked in advance, which reinforces that the prior action was about securing a table, not making a conditional statement.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
