  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: vision\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the ability to see; the visual faculty (e.g., \"Her vision is clearer with glasses.\")\n2. the formation of a mental image of something that is not perceived as real and is not present to the senses (e.g., \"Her vision of the future inspired everyone.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: \nAlex woke up to a bright light flooding his room. He rubbed his eyes, trying to make sense of the strange shapes and colors. The images danced before him, indistinct and puzzling.\nSentence containing the homonym: Alex found it hard to clear his vision.\nEnding: He went to the bathroom and poured water over his eyes, and lo and behold, he was able to see clearly.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Alex seeing strange shapes and colors, suggesting a physical visual experience, making the sensory meaning of \"vision\" highly plausible.  \n• The sentence \"Alex found it hard to clear his vision\" follows naturally from the prior description of blurry, indistinct images—this is a common expression for visual clarity, supporting meaning 1.  \n• The ending confirms that Alex regains clear sight by rinsing his eyes, which directly supports the physical, sensory interpretation of \"vision\" and rules out the mental/imagined sense.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
