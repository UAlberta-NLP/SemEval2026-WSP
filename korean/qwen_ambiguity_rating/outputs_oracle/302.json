  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: comfortable\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. providing or experiencing physical well-being or relief ('comfy' is informal) (e.g., \"She wore comfortable shoes for walking.\")\n2. free from stress or conducive to mental ease; having or affording peace of mind (e.g., \"She felt comfortable in her new role.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: David moved to a small town last week. He had found a house that seemed perfect for his needs. Everything looked fine when he first arrived.\nSentence containing the homonym: David did not feel comfortable in his new house.\nEnding: He thought this might change if he asked a priest to bless his house.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Physical comfort (meaning 1) is less plausible because the precontext emphasizes the house seeming \"perfect\" and the focus is on David’s emotional state, not physical footwear or furniture.  \n• Mental/psychological comfort (meaning 2) is highly plausible, as David feels uneasy in his new environment, which aligns with the idea of emotional or mental unease after moving.  \n• The ending, where he considers asking a priest to bless the house, suggests a need for spiritual or emotional reassurance, reinforcing the idea that he feels \"uncomfortable\" in a mental/emotional sense, not physically.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
