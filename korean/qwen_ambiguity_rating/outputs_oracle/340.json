He had promised Peter they would settle a matter once and for all. The weather was perfect for their meeting place.\nSentence containing the homonym: Joe was to meet Peter at the bank that morning.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Joe and Peter meeting to \"settle a matter once and for all,\" which strongly suggests a meeting place, making the institution meaning (bank as a financial building) plausible.  \n• The phrase \"meet at the bank\" is a common collocation for a financial institution, especially in everyday language, reinforcing the building meaning.  \n• The geographical meaning (\"riverbank\") would be odd in this context, as a riverbank is not a typical meeting place for resolving personal matters, and no environmental or natural setting is mentioned.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
