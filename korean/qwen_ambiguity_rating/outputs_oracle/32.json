  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: coached\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. teach and supervise (someone); act as a trainer or coach (to), as in sports (e.g., \"The coach trains the players daily.\")\n2. drive a coach (e.g., \"The coach drove us to the game.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom had always loved sports and vintage vehicles. When the team asked for his help, he couldn't refuse. He saw this as an opportunity to combine his two passions.\nSentence containing the homonym: He coached the team all the way to the championship.\nEnding: He always loved to drive his team around.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Coached the team\" fits well with the precontext, which emphasizes Tom's passion for sports and his willingness to help the team.  \n• \"Drive a coach\" is inconsistent with the precontext, which focuses on sports, not vehicle driving, and the ending refers to driving a vehicle, not coaching.  \n• The ending explicitly states \"He always loved to drive his team around,\" which confirms that \"team\" refers to a vehicle, not a sports team, thus ruling out the coaching meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
