  "explanation": "• The phrase \"The suit made him angry\" is more likely to refer to the clothing meaning, as anger triggered by wearing the wrong outfit aligns with the ending that he had the wrong set of clothing.  \n• The legal meaning (\"a suit for damages\") is implausible here, as there is no mention of legal action, court, or legal remedy, and the context focuses on personal discomfort and clothing.  \n• The ending explicitly confirms the clothing interpretation by stating he realized he had the wrong set of clothing on, directly supporting the first meaning.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: suit\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a set of garments (usually including a jacket and trousers or skirt) for outerwear all of the same fabric and color (e.g., \"He wore a tailored suit to the event.\")\n2. a comprehensive term for any proceeding in a court of law whereby an individual seeks a legal remedy (e.g., \"They filed a suit for damages.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John never liked early mornings. Today was different; he had an important meeting. There was something unsettling about the day ahead.\nSentence containing the homonym: The suit made him angry.\nEnding: He realized he had the wrong set of clothing on.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"The suit made him angry\" is more likely to refer to the clothing meaning, as anger triggered by wearing the wrong outfit aligns with the ending that he had the wrong set of clothing.  \n• The legal meaning (\"a suit for damages\") is implausible here, as there is no mention of legal action, court, or legal remedy, and the context focuses on personal discomfort and clothing.  \n• The ending explicitly confirms the clothing interpretation by stating he realized he had the wrong set of clothing on, directly supporting the first meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
