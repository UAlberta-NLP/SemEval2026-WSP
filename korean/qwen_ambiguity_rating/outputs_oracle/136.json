  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jack had always loved the thrill of mountain biking. Every weekend, he packed his gear and headed to the trails. He felt alive and unstoppable once he left the familiar comfort of home.\nSentence containing the homonym: He started going downhill after leaving home.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes Jack's love for mountain biking and his journey to trails, strongly suggesting a physical movement toward the bottom of a hill.  \n• \"Going downhill\" in the context of mountain biking is a common and literal phrase referring to descending a slope, making meaning #2 highly plausible.  \n• Meaning #1 (toward a lower or inferior state) is semantically mismatched with the physical, active context of biking and leaving home; it would be odd to interpret \"going downhill\" as a decline in health or status here.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
