  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emily always loved the view from the top of Ridge Hill. Last year, she had opened her dream restaurant there, hoping to attract tourists. But, they recently decided to relocate to the valley.\nSentence containing the homonym: The restaurant has gone downhill since moving sites.\nEnding: Erosion has caused this.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext establishes that Emily’s restaurant is located on Ridge Hill and is relocating to the valley, making a \"downhill\" shift in location highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"gone downhill\" in the sentence, combined with the ending about erosion causing the decline, strongly supports a deterioration in the restaurant’s condition or success, not a physical movement.  \n• The physical meaning (\"toward the bottom of a hill\") is contradicted by the context: the restaurant is already relocating to the valley, which is a downward movement in location, but the sentence refers to the restaurant’s condition, not its position.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
