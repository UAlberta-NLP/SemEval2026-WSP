  "explanation": "• \"Dribbling\" referring to moving the soccer ball fits the precontext of Tommy preparing for fun at the park and playing with his dad.  \n• The physical description of wetness on his chin later in the sentence suggests salivation, making the second meaning plausible but not directly tied to the main action.  \n• The sequence of events—preparation for play, constant dribbling, then a separate observation of wetness—implies the dribbling is a separate, ongoing activity from the salivation, which occurs later.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: dribbling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. propel, (e.g., \"He likes to dribble the basketball.\")\n2. let saliva drivel from the mouth (e.g., \"The baby began to dribble with joy.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tommy was excited as he headed to the park with his dad. He carried his soccer ball tightly under his arm. They found a spot near the benches and prepared for some fun.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had been dribbling constantly.\nEnding: A small trail of wetness appeared on his chin as he watched the playful puppies chase each other.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Dribbling\" referring to moving the soccer ball fits the precontext of Tommy preparing for fun at the park and playing with his dad.  \n• The physical description of wetness on his chin later in the sentence suggests salivation, making the second meaning plausible but not directly tied to the main action.  \n• The sequence of events—preparation for play, constant dribbling, then a separate observation of wetness—implies the dribbling is a separate, ongoing activity from the salivation, which occurs later.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
