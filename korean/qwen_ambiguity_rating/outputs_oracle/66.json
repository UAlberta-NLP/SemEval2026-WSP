  "explanation": "• The precontext about Lena’s fashion business and competitors copying designs strongly supports the meaning of \"suits\" as clothing.  \n• The sentence \"The suits became costly\" fits naturally with fashion garments, as cost is a common attribute of clothing lines.  \n• The ending mentioning \"sophisticated attire\" confirms that \"suits\" refers to clothing, not legal proceedings.",
