  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fiddling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. avoid (one's assigned duties) (e.g., \"He decided to fiddle with his responsibilities.\")\n2. play the violin or fiddle (e.g., \"She loves to fiddle at night.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom joined the band last month. He spent a lot of time in the practice room. The band noticed his commitment right away.\nSentence containing the homonym: The team was not impressed with Tom's fiddling.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext indicates Tom joined a band and spent time in the practice room, strongly suggesting musical activity.  \n• \"Fiddling\" as avoiding duties does not align with the context of someone actively practicing in a band.  \n• \"Fiddling\" as playing the violin is directly supported by the band context and the practice room setting.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
