  "explanation": "• The phrase \"The suit made him angry\" fits naturally with meaning 1 (a set of garments) because clothing can evoke emotional reactions, especially in a suggestive context.  \n• Meaning 2 (a legal proceeding) is implausible here, as there is no mention of court, legal action, or a claim, and the precontext focuses on John’s physical discomfort and appearance.  \n• The ending \"It accentuated his bottom in a most suggestive way\" strongly confirms the garment interpretation, as it refers to physical appearance and body shape, not a legal case.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: suit\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a set of garments (usually including a jacket and trousers or skirt) for outerwear all of the same fabric and color (e.g., \"He wore a tailored suit to the event.\")\n2. a comprehensive term for any proceeding in a court of law whereby an individual seeks a legal remedy (e.g., \"They filed a suit for damages.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John never liked early mornings. Today was different; he had an important meeting. There was something unsettling about the day ahead.\nSentence containing the homonym: The suit made him angry.\nEnding: It accentuated his bottom in a most suggestive way.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"The suit made him angry\" fits naturally with meaning 1 (a set of garments) because clothing can evoke emotional reactions, especially in a suggestive context.  \n• Meaning 2 (a legal proceeding) is implausible here, as there is no mention of court, legal action, or a claim, and the precontext focuses on John’s physical discomfort and appearance.  \n• The ending \"It accentuated his bottom in a most suggestive way\" strongly confirms the garment interpretation, as it refers to physical appearance and body shape, not a legal case.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
