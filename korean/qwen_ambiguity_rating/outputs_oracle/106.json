  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: reservations\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an unstated doubt that prevents you from accepting something wholeheartedly (e.g., \"She accepted the offer with some reservation.\")\n2. the act of reserving (a place or passage) or engaging the services of (a person or group) (e.g., \"I made a reservation for dinner.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Lily and Mark arrived in town late in the afternoon. They were tired from their long trip and needed a place to stay. After some discussion, they decided to check out the hotel by the river.\nSentence containing the homonym: They both had reservations about staying at the hotel.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (unstated doubt) is plausible, as the phrase \"had reservations about staying\" commonly expresses hesitation or skepticism in such contexts.  \n• Meaning 2 (booking a place) is inconsistent with the context, as Lily and Mark have already arrived and are discussing staying at a hotel—there is no indication they are making a booking.  \n• The precontext strongly supports the emotional/attitudinal meaning, as the focus is on their feelings and decisions, not on making a reservation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
