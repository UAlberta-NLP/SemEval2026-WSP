  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: picture\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a visual representation (of an object or scene or person or abstraction) produced on a surface (e.g., \"She shared a beautiful picture of the sunset.\")\n2. a situation treated as an observable object (e.g., \"The economic picture is improving steadily.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emma arrived at the boardroom early that morning. She spent the previous night preparing her material carefully. The picture she was ready to share was going to be key to the discussion.\nSentence containing the homonym: The picture she presented at the meeting was both striking and thought-provoking.\nEnding: Everyone was thoroughly impressed by her images.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Emma preparing \"material\" and presenting a \"picture\" at a meeting, which strongly suggests a visual representation.  \n• The sentence describes the picture as \"striking and thought-provoking,\" a description typically applied to visual images, not abstract economic conditions.  \n• The ending states \"Everyone was thoroughly impressed by her images,\" confirming the meaning as visual representations, not abstract situations.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
