  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: suits\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a set of garments (usually including a jacket and trousers or skirt) for outerwear all of the same fabric and color (e.g., \"He wore a tailored suit to the event.\")\n2. a comprehensive term for any proceeding in a court of law whereby an individual seeks a legal remedy (e.g., \"They filed a suit for damages.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jake was finally called in for his meeting. He sat in the waiting room, going over everything in his mind. The room was filled with murmurs and hushed conversations.\nSentence containing the homonym: The suits were interesting, to say the least.\nEnding: Everyone looked very smart in their new attire.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The mention of \"suits\" in the context of a waiting room filled with murmurs and hushed conversations, followed by \"Everyone looked very smart in their new attire,\" strongly suggests clothing as the meaning.  \n• The legal meaning (\"a suit in court\") is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of legal proceedings, courtrooms, or legal disputes.  \n• The post-context confirmation of \"new attire\" and \"looked very smart\" directly reinforces the clothing meaning and makes the legal meaning implausible.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
