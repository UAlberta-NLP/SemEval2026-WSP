  "explanation": "• The phrase \"go to the trailer tonight\" is more likely to refer to a vehicle in the context of evening plans and travel, given the mention of \"cramped space with thin walls\" and \"smell of the toilet\" associated with a trailer as a living space.  \n• The meaning of \"trailer\" as an advertisement does not fit the context, as there is no mention of movies, film promotions, or viewing content.  \n• The ending explicitly references a physical space with walls and a toilet smell, strongly supporting the interpretation of a trailer as a mobile dwelling, not a film advertisement.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: trailer\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an advertisement consisting of short scenes from a motion picture that will appear in the near future (e.g., \"I watched the new movie trailer online.\")\n2. a wheeled vehicle that can be pulled by a car or truck and is equipped for occupancy (e.g., \"They traveled cross-country in their trailer.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emma glanced at her phone, checking the time. The evening plans were about to start, and she felt pressure from her friends. They were all eager to see what the night had in store.\nSentence containing the homonym: She really didn't want to go to the trailer tonight.\nEnding: She still has nightmares from the last time she was in a cramped space with thin walls, and the smell of the toilet always made her stomach turn.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"go to the trailer tonight\" is more likely to refer to a vehicle in the context of evening plans and travel, given the mention of \"cramped space with thin walls\" and \"smell of the toilet\" associated with a trailer as a living space.  \n• The meaning of \"trailer\" as an advertisement does not fit the context, as there is no mention of movies, film promotions, or viewing content.  \n• The ending explicitly references a physical space with walls and a toilet smell, strongly supporting the interpretation of a trailer as a mobile dwelling, not a film advertisement.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
