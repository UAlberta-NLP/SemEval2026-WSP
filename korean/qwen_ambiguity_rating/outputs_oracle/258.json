Each time, he approached them with determination. Now he stood before yet another one.\nSentence containing the homonym: This will be his third try.\nEnding: And as the saying goes, the third time is a charm, so he knew he would succeed.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Try\" as \"make an effort\" is strongly supported by the precontext, which emphasizes John's determination and repeated attempts to overcome challenges.  \n• \"Try\" as \"put on trial\" is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of legal proceedings, judges, or cases being heard.  \n• The ending reinforces the interpretation of \"try\" as an attempt, citing the common phrase \"the third time is a charm,\" which refers to repeated efforts, not legal trials.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
