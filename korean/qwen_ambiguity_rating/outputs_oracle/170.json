Everyone knew that their work required secrecy and careful planning. They needed to make adjustments to ensure everything went smoothly.\nSentence containing the homonym: There was a suggestion that they should move underground for the next stage of the process.\nEnding: That way, nobody could discover their hidden plans.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Move underground\" in the context of secrecy and hidden plans strongly supports the second meaning (conducted with hidden aims) as the precontext and ending explicitly reference hidden intentions.  \n• The first meaning (under the level of the ground) is implausible because the setting is a dimly lit room, and there is no mention of physical infrastructure or subterranean locations.  \n• The ending \"nobody could discover their hidden plans\" directly reinforces the metaphorical use of \"underground\" to mean secret or hidden, confirming the second meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
