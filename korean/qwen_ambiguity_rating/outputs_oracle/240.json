  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fiddle\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. avoid (one's assigned duties) (e.g., \"He decided to fiddle with his responsibilities.\")\n2. play the violin or fiddle (e.g., \"She loves to fiddle at night.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Rachel and Tom had been friends since childhood. They often found themselves overwhelmed by their daily responsibilities. One day, they came across an old violin in the attic.\nSentence containing the homonym: They both decided to fiddle together.\nEnding: It was a much easier way to pass the time of day and responsibility.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Fiddle together\" as in avoiding responsibilities fits the precontext of being overwhelmed and passing the time, and the ending explicitly mentions \"passing the time of day and responsibility,\" supporting this meaning.  \n• \"Fiddle together\" as in playing the violin is plausible given the mention of an old violin in the attic, and playing instruments is a natural activity in such a setting.  \n• However, the ending emphasizes \"passing the time of day and responsibility,\" which aligns more with avoiding duties than with musical activity, making the avoidance meaning more contextually grounded.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
