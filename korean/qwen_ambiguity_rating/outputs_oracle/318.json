  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: snorted\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. make a snorting sound by exhaling hard (e.g., \"He snorted in disbelief at the news.\")\n2. inhale recreational drugs (e.g., \"He was caught snorting powder in the bathroom.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom stumbled into the dimly lit room, his head spinning from exhaustion. The party had been wild, and the music still echoed in his mind. He leaned against the wall, trying to steady himself in the quiet that followed.\nSentence containing the homonym: He snorted and heard a loud noise from outside.\nEnding: Tom's exhalation alerted the people making the loud noise outside, who came in to investigate what it could be.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"He snorted\" as a physical exhalation fits the precontext of Tom struggling with exhaustion and leaning against a wall, aligning with a natural bodily reaction in quiet.  \n• \"He snorted\" as drug inhalation is inconsistent with the precontext, which emphasizes exhaustion and a chaotic party, not drug use, and provides no hint of drug-related behavior.  \n• The ending clarifies that Tom's exhalation alerted others, which matches the physical sound interpretation, not drug inhalation, which would not produce an audible \"alert\" in this way.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
