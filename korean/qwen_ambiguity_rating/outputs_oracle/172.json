First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes secrecy and careful planning, making the figurative \"underground\" meaning (hidden operations) highly plausible.  \n• The literal \"underground\" (beneath the ground) is inconsistent with the setting described—a dimly lit room discussing a secret project—where physical underground infrastructure is not implied.  \n• The phrase \"move underground\" in a context of secrecy naturally aligns with the metaphorical sense of covert operations, not a physical relocation beneath the earth.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
