  "explanation": "• \"Pick the fruit from the tree\" aligns with the meaning of selecting carefully from a group, supported by the precontext of gathering the best apples.  \n• The physical act of pulling fruit from a tree with a plucking motion is less likely given the context, as the sentence emphasizes careful selection, not mechanical harvesting.  \n• The ending, where Emma \"looked very carefully to assess which apples were perfect,\" reinforces the selection/evaluation meaning, ruling out the physical plucking interpretation.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pick\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. select carefully from a group (e.g., \"She had to pick a winner.\")\n2. pull lightly but sharply with a plucking motion (e.g., \"She will pick a string gently.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emma walked through the orchard with a basket in her hand. The trees were full of ripe, red apples, and she hesitated for a moment. Her mother had told her to gather the very best ones.\nSentence containing the homonym: She had to pick the fruit from the tree before it fell.\nEnding: She looked very carefully to assess which of the apples were perfect.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Pick the fruit from the tree\" aligns with the meaning of selecting carefully from a group, supported by the precontext of gathering the best apples.  \n• The physical act of pulling fruit from a tree with a plucking motion is less likely given the context, as the sentence emphasizes careful selection, not mechanical harvesting.  \n• The ending, where Emma \"looked very carefully to assess which apples were perfect,\" reinforces the selection/evaluation meaning, ruling out the physical plucking interpretation.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
