  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: reservations\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an unstated doubt that prevents you from accepting something wholeheartedly (e.g., \"She accepted the offer with some reservation.\")\n2. the act of reserving (a place or passage) or engaging the services of (a person or group) (e.g., \"I made a reservation for dinner.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The couple glanced at the old map lying on the table. The distant village promised an adventure they had been seeking for a long time. They discussed the possibility of visiting that mysterious, often discussed place.\nSentence containing the homonym: They had reservations but still continued despite the situation.\nEnding: Rolling up the map and grabbing their pack, they made their way toward the location.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (unstated doubt) is plausible, as the couple is considering a risky or uncertain adventure, and \"reservations\" could reflect hesitation despite the allure of the destination.  \n• Meaning 2 (reserving a place) is less plausible, as there is no mention of booking a hotel, travel service, or making a formal arrangement—no indication of a place being reserved.  \n• The precontext and ending focus on decision-making and movement, not on logistical arrangements, which weakens the reservation-as-booking interpretation.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
