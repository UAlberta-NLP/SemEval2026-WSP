  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: docked\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. deprive someone of benefits, as a penalty (e.g., \"They decided to dock his pay unfairly.\")\n2. come into dock (e.g., \"The ship will dock at noon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Sean had always dreamt of working by the sea. His job at the harbor kept him busy, overseeing shipments and coordinating arrivals. Yesterday, a hiccup in the schedule threw everything into chaos.\nSentence containing the homonym: Sean was docked pay as soon as he arrived late yesterday.\nEnding: He was annoyed by this removal of income.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (deprive someone of benefits) is strongly supported by the precontext and ending, which explicitly mention a removal of income and Sean’s annoyance.  \n• Meaning 2 (come into dock) is inconsistent with the context, as the sentence discusses a pay deduction, not a ship arriving. The harbor setting does not imply a ship docking at Sean’s arrival.  \n• The phrase \"docked pay\" is a common collocation for penal deductions, and the ending confirms the removal of income, reinforcing the financial penalty interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
