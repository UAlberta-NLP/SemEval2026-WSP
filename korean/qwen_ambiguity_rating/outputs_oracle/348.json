  "explanation": "• The precontext describes a market scene with colorful stalls and fresh sights, making the fruit meaning highly plausible and contextually grounded.  \n• The phrase \"That peach over there is grabbing her attention\" uses \"peach\" in a way that aligns with the fruit meaning, as attention is drawn to a visually appealing, fresh product.  \n• The ending explicitly refers to the fruit as \"juicy and fresh,\" which strongly confirms the fruit meaning and directly contradicts the woman-as-attraction interpretation.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: peach\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. downy juicy fruit with sweet yellowish or whitish flesh (e.g., \"She enjoyed a ripe peach for dessert.\")\n2. a very attractive or seductive looking woman (e.g., \"She was a knockout at the party.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: She wandered through the busy market. Stalls lined the street, filled with colorful sights and sounds. Her gaze drifted, catching various things and people.\nSentence containing the homonym: That peach over there is grabbing her attention.\nEnding: It looked so juicy and fresh that she wanted to go and buy it.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a market scene with colorful stalls and fresh sights, making the fruit meaning highly plausible and contextually grounded.  \n• The phrase \"That peach over there is grabbing her attention\" uses \"peach\" in a way that aligns with the fruit meaning, as attention is drawn to a visually appealing, fresh product.  \n• The ending explicitly refers to the fruit as \"juicy and fresh,\" which strongly confirms the fruit meaning and directly contradicts the woman-as-attraction interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
