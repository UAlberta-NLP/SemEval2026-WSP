  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: trailer\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an advertisement consisting of short scenes from a motion picture that will appear in the near future (e.g., \"I watched the new movie trailer online.\")\n2. a wheeled vehicle that can be pulled by a car or truck and is equipped for occupancy (e.g., \"They traveled cross-country in their trailer.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Anna drove to the edge of town. She had heard there was something new to see. People said it promised to be exciting.\nSentence containing the homonym: She watched the trailer carefully.\nEnding: She eagerly discussed the plot with her friends, excited to see how the movie would unfold.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Anna hearing about something new to see and people saying it promised to be exciting, which strongly suggests a movie-related context.  \n• The sentence \"She watched the trailer carefully\" follows a common pattern where \"trailer\" refers to a movie preview, especially when paired with \"discuss the plot\" and \"how the movie would unfold.\"  \n• The ending explicitly mentions discussing the plot and excitement about the movie, which confirms the interpretation of \"trailer\" as a movie preview, not a vehicle.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
