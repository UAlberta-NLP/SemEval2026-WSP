(botany) a living organism lacking the power of locomotion (e.g., \"The garden has a beautiful plant.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The theatre was bustling with people that evening. Everyone was excited for the premiere of the new play. The director had made some unexpected choices for the show.\nSentence containing the homonym: The plant in the theatre went unnoticed.\nEnding: The only thing they did see was the décor.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describing a bustling theatre and a premiere suggests a setting where audience members and stage elements are relevant, making the \"actor in the audience\" meaning plausible.  \n• The phrase \"the plant in the theatre\" fits naturally with the theatrical setting, and \"went unnoticed\" aligns with an audience member being hidden or unobserved.  \n• The botanical meaning (\"a living organism\") is inconsistent with the context of a theatre and the mention of \"decor\" as the only thing seen, as plants in a garden or botanical sense would not be \"in the theatre\" in this scenario.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
