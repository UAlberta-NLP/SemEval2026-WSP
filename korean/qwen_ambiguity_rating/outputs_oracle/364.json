  "explanation": "• The precontext mentions \"rearranging their plans\" and \"different schedules,\" which strongly supports the meaning of \"capable of being changed\" in the context of scheduling.  \n• The phrase \"flexible when going to the gym\" does not suggest physical bending of limbs or materials, as there is no mention of physical objects or movement in the gym setting.  \n• The meaning \"able to bend easily\" would require a physical object (like a branch or a joint), which is absent in the context of people rearranging gym plans.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: flexible\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. capable of being changed (e.g., \"She has a flexible work schedule.\")\n2. able to flex; able to bend easily (e.g., \"The flexible branches swayed in the breeze.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Mark and Lisa both enjoy staying active. They have different schedules each week. Sometimes they rearrange their plans to work out together.\nSentence containing the homonym: They are quite flexible when going to the gym.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions \"rearranging their plans\" and \"different schedules,\" which strongly supports the meaning of \"capable of being changed\" in the context of scheduling.  \n• The phrase \"flexible when going to the gym\" does not suggest physical bending of limbs or materials, as there is no mention of physical objects or movement in the gym setting.  \n• The meaning \"able to bend easily\" would require a physical object (like a branch or a joint), which is absent in the context of people rearranging gym plans.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
