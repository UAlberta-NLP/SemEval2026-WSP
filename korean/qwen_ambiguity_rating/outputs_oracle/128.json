  "explanation": "• \"Things going downhill\" refers to a decline in John's health or mood, not a physical path, given the precontext about weather and a run.  \n• The physical meaning (\"toward the bottom of a hill\") is ruled out because the sentence is not about movement through terrain, and no hill is mentioned in the context.  \n• The phrase \"going downhill\" in the context of a run and weather changes strongly suggests a deterioration in condition or mood, not a physical descent.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n2. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John had set out on his morning run with high hopes. The path led him through the park, past the towering trees and lush hills. As he picked up speed, he could feel a change in the air.\nSentence containing the homonym: Things were going downhill.\nEnding: The change in weather made him think it might rain, which would ruin his run.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Things going downhill\" refers to a decline in John's health or mood, not a physical path, given the precontext about weather and a run.  \n• The physical meaning (\"toward the bottom of a hill\") is ruled out because the sentence is not about movement through terrain, and no hill is mentioned in the context.  \n• The phrase \"going downhill\" in the context of a run and weather changes strongly suggests a deterioration in condition or mood, not a physical descent.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
