  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: croak\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. pass from physical life and lose all bodily attributes and functions necessary to sustain life (e.g., \"He feared he might croak soon.\")\n2. utter a hoarse sound, like a raven (e.g., \"The raven began to croak loudly.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Lily was sitting by the pond, listening to the gentle rustling of the leaves. She had been visiting this spot every day, hoping to see some wildlife. A frog appeared on a rock, looking still and mysterious.\nSentence containing the homonym: The frog began to croak.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The frog making a sound like a croak is a common and expected behavior for frogs in the natural environment described.  \n• The meaning of \"pass from physical life\" does not fit, as the frog is still visible and active, and the context describes it as \"looking still and mysterious,\" not dying.  \n• The precontext emphasizes auditory observation (\"listening to the gentle rustling\") and wildlife, making the sound-based meaning highly plausible and contextually grounded.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
