They planned to test the resilience of certain variables under stress. As the trial began, everyone was eager to observe the outcomes.\nSentence containing the homonym: The identities did not change, given the circumstances.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (personal identity) is plausible, as the scientists' personal traits or roles might be considered stable despite experimental stress.  \n• Meaning 2 (mathematical identity) is implausible, as the context involves scientific experimentation and variables, not abstract algebraic operations.  \n• The precontext and sentence structure strongly favor a psychological/personal interpretation of \"identities\" in a human subject context.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
