He trained hard for months and his determination never wavered. Everyone knew how important this day was to him.\nSentence containing the homonym: He was successful in achieving his goal in the match.\nEnding: The crowd erupted as he scored.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Achieving his goal\" aligns with the precontext of hard training and determination, suggesting a personal objective or ambition.  \n• \"Scoring the winning goal\" is supported by the ending and the setting of a match, making it a strong candidate for the sports meaning.  \n• The sentence uses \"achieving his goal\" in a way that could be interpreted as either personal success or a match outcome, but the precontext emphasizes personal effort and motivation, not athletic performance.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
