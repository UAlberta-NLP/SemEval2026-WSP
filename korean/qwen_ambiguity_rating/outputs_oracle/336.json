  "explanation": "• The precontext mentions a meeting place and the weather being perfect, suggesting a physical location outdoors, which supports \"bank\" as sloping land beside a body of water.  \n• The phrase \"meet at the bank\" in a natural setting with gumboots and navigation implies a geographical feature rather than a financial institution.  \n• The ending explicitly references \"gumboots\" and \"navigate easily,\" reinforcing a physical, outdoor location, ruling out a bank as a financial building.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: bank\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water) (e.g., \"The children played near the riverbank.\")\n2. a building in which the business of banking transacted (e.g., \"She visited the bank to deposit money.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Joe woke up early, excited for the day ahead. He had promised Peter they would settle a matter once and for all. The weather was perfect for their meeting place.\nSentence containing the homonym: Joe was to meet Peter at the bank that morning.\nEnding: He wore his gumboots to ensure that he would be able to navigate easily and get to the meeting point with ease.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions a meeting place and the weather being perfect, suggesting a physical location outdoors, which supports \"bank\" as sloping land beside a body of water.  \n• The phrase \"meet at the bank\" in a natural setting with gumboots and navigation implies a geographical feature rather than a financial institution.  \n• The ending explicitly references \"gumboots\" and \"navigate easily,\" reinforcing a physical, outdoor location, ruling out a bank as a financial building.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
