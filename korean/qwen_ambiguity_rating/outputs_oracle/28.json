The crowd's roar was deafening, echoing through every corner. He took a deep breath, knowing that the next few moments were critical.\nSentence containing the homonym: He wasn't sure if his guts could handle the pressure of the situation.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Tom feeling anxious and under pressure, making \"guts\" as in courage or determination highly plausible.  \n• \"Guts\" as the digestive tract is not contextually relevant; there is no mention of physical health, medical examination, or internal anatomy.  \n• The phrase \"could handle the pressure\" strongly aligns with psychological or emotional resilience, not a bodily organ.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
