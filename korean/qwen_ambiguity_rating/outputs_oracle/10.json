  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: dribbling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. propel, (e.g., \"He likes to dribble the basketball.\")\n2. let saliva drivel from the mouth (e.g., \"The baby began to dribble with joy.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tommy was excited as he headed to the park with his dad. He carried his soccer ball tightly under his arm. They found a spot near the benches and prepared for some fun.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had been dribbling constantly.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Dribbling the basketball is highly plausible given that Tommy is with his dad at the park and preparing for fun with a soccer ball, suggesting a physical activity context.  \n• Saliva dribbling is implausible because the context involves excitement and physical activity, with no mention of oral secretions or infantile behavior.  \n• The precontext strongly supports a physical action (playing soccer/ball games), making the \"propel\" meaning dominant and the \"saliva\" meaning irrelevant.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
