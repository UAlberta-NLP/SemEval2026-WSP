(usually followed by 'on' or 'for') in readiness (e.g., \"She was up on her studies.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Lily had stayed up late the night before, going over her notes one last time. She knew how important this exam was for her future. Her alarm was set for early in the morning to give her plenty of time to prepare.\nSentence containing the homonym: By 6 a.m., she was already up and ready for the big exam.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Up\" meaning \"out of bed\" is strongly supported by the precontext (stayed up late, alarm set for early morning) and the phrase \"already up and ready\" indicating she has awakened.  \n• \"Up\" meaning \"in readiness\" is plausible but secondary; the phrase \"up and ready\" is common, but the precontext emphasizes physical wakefulness, not just mental preparation.  \n• The context strongly favors physical awakening over mental readiness, as the narrative focuses on time, sleep, and preparation logistics.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
