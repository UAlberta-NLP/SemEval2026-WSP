  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: log\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a segment of the trunk of a tree when stripped of branches (e.g., \"The firewood was made from a log.\")\n2. a written record of events on a voyage (of a ship or plane) (e.g., \"The captain maintained a detailed log.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The siblings spent their summer exploring the beach. They often searched for interesting things that washed ashore. One day, they stumbled upon something curious hidden in the sand.\nSentence containing the homonym: They discovered an old log near the shore that revealed a lot about the past.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions the siblings searching for items washed ashore, making a tree trunk (wood) a plausible and contextually relevant object found in the sand.  \n• A ship or plane log is unlikely in this context, as there is no mention of maritime activity or vessels, and \"log\" as a record would not naturally be \"found in the sand.\"  \n• The phrase \"revealed a lot about the past\" fits well with a historical record (like a ship log), but the physical discovery of an object in the sand strongly suggests a literal, physical item rather than a written record.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
