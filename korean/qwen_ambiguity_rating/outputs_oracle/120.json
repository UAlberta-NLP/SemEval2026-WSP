  "explanation": "• The precontext about John biking and market stalls suggests a decline in the market's condition, making \"downhill\" as a decline in state highly plausible.  \n• \"Downhill\" referring to a physical slope is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of a hill or physical route in the market setting.  \n• The ending about difficulty continuing the biking adventure supports the idea of a deteriorating situation, reinforcing the metaphorical meaning of decline.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John started a biking adventure last month. He rides past the local marketplace on his favorite track. Recently, people have noticed fewer stalls on his route.\nSentence containing the homonym: The market has been downhill lately, and this is really affecting John.\nEnding: It has become challenging for him to continue riding.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext about John biking and market stalls suggests a decline in the market's condition, making \"downhill\" as a decline in state highly plausible.  \n• \"Downhill\" referring to a physical slope is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of a hill or physical route in the market setting.  \n• The ending about difficulty continuing the biking adventure supports the idea of a deteriorating situation, reinforcing the metaphorical meaning of decline.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
