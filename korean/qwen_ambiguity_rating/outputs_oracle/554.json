  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: logs\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a segment of the trunk of a tree when stripped of branches (e.g., \"The firewood was made from a log.\")\n2. a written record of events on a voyage (of a ship or plane) (e.g., \"The captain maintained a detailed log.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Anna lived near the forest and loved spending her afternoons there. Every weekend, she would venture out to explore and discover new things. Her love for documenting each adventure grew with every trip she took.\nSentence containing the homonym: She enjoys her collection of logs.\nEnding: She is always so articulate in her documentaries.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Anna exploring the forest and documenting her adventures, making a collection of \"logs\" as firewood highly unlikely.  \n• The phrase \"collection of logs\" in the context of documenting adventures strongly aligns with a written record (e.g., a logbook), especially given the mention of \"documentaries\" and \"documenting each adventure.\"  \n• The ending emphasizes her articulateness in \"documentaries,\" which supports the interpretation of \"logs\" as written records, not physical tree segments.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
