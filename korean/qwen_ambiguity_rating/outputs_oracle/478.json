  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: point\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. sharp end (e.g., \"He carefully carved the point of the stick.\")\n2. a brief version of the essential meaning of something (e.g., \"Make your point clearly and concisely.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John was always a bit of a daydreamer. He often got lost in his own world, doodling shapes and scribbles. His friends watched, waiting for him to say something.\nSentence containing the homonym: He took a long time to reach the point.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes John as a daydreamer who doodles shapes and scribbles, suggesting a focus on visual or abstract expressions, making \"point\" as a sharp end (physical object) unlikely.  \n• \"Reach the point\" in the context of someone who is lost in thought and doodling strongly implies understanding or grasping a key idea, aligning with meaning #2 (a brief version of the essential meaning).  \n• There is no indication of a physical object like a stick or tool being used, so meaning #1 (sharp end) lacks contextual support and is implausible.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
