  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: goal\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the state of affairs that a plan is intended to achieve and that (when achieved) terminates behavior intended to achieve it (e.g., \"Achieving your goal is essential for success.\")\n2. a successful attempt at scoring (e.g., \"She scored the winning goal yesterday.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The team had been training hard for months. Every player was focused on improving their skills on the field. The goalkeeper put in extra hours, determined to make a difference in the upcoming match.\nSentence containing the homonym: The goalkeeper had reached his goal.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes training and performance on the field, suggesting a focus on athletic outcomes, making the sports-related meaning (scoring) plausible.  \n• The phrase \"reached his goal\" in a team context, especially involving a goalkeeper, is a common expression in sports for achieving a desired outcome, such as a win or a key performance.  \n• The meaning of \"goal\" as a desired state or outcome (e.g., success) is less likely here because the sentence is about the goalkeeper’s actions, not his personal ambition or success in a broader sense.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
