  "explanation": "• \"Flop on stage\" in the context of a dancer making an entrance strongly suggests a physical fall, given the setting and the precontext of preparation and nerves, which makes physical movement plausible.  \n• The meaning \"fail utterly\" is less supported because the ending attributes the outcome to bad luck and a difficult song, not a failure in performance or a collapse, which would imply a failure of execution or content.  \n• The physical \"flop\" fits the narrative flow—nervous dancer, enters, stumbles—while the failure meaning would require a different kind of outcome (e.g., poor audience reception), which is not directly implied.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: flop\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. fall loosely (e.g., \"She flopped onto the soft couch.\")\n2. fail utterly; collapse (e.g., \"The presentation was a complete flop.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Lila had been practicing for weeks, hoping to impress the audience. The stage was set, and the lights dimmed as the crowd waited eagerly. Backstage, she took a deep breath, feeling both excitement and nerves.\nSentence containing the homonym: After all the preparations, the dancer made an entrance, only to flop on stage.\nEnding: She was just unlucky to have chosen the most difficult song on Earth.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Flop on stage\" in the context of a dancer making an entrance strongly suggests a physical fall, given the setting and the precontext of preparation and nerves, which makes physical movement plausible.  \n• The meaning \"fail utterly\" is less supported because the ending attributes the outcome to bad luck and a difficult song, not a failure in performance or a collapse, which would imply a failure of execution or content.  \n• The physical \"flop\" fits the narrative flow—nervous dancer, enters, stumbles—while the failure meaning would require a different kind of outcome (e.g., poor audience reception), which is not directly implied.\n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
