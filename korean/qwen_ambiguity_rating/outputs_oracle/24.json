The crowd's roar was deafening, echoing through every corner. He took a deep breath, knowing that the next few moments were critical.\nSentence containing the homonym: He wasn't sure if his guts could handle the pressure of the situation.\nEnding: He really hadn't been feeling well lately and thought they could literally explode.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes emotional tension and internal struggle, making \"guts\" as in fortitude highly plausible.  \n• The biological meaning (\"part of the alimentary canal\") is inconsistent with the emotional and psychological tone of the scene.  \n• The ending mentioning \"literally explode\" supports a physical interpretation, but this is a stretch and likely refers to the body, not emotional strength.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
