The stage was set, and the lights dimmed as the crowd waited eagerly. Backstage, she took a deep breath, feeling both excitement and nerves.\nSentence containing the homonym: After all the preparations, the dancer made an entrance, only to flop on stage.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Flop\" as a loose fall (meaning 1) is implausible because the context emphasizes preparation and performance, and a dancer \"flop[ing] on stage\" would be uncharacteristic and inconsistent with the expected dramatic entrance.  \n• \"Flop\" as a total failure (meaning 2) is highly plausible, given the precontext of weeks of practice and audience anticipation—sudden failure on stage fits the narrative of a disastrous outcome.  \n• The verb \"flop\" in the sentence is used in a way that suggests a dramatic collapse, not a gentle landing, and the setting (performance stage) strongly supports the failure interpretation.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
