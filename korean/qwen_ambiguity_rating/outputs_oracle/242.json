  "explanation": "• \"Fiddle\" meaning \"to avoid responsibilities\" is implausible because the context involves finding a violin and playing music, not avoiding duties.  \n• \"Fiddle\" meaning \"to play the violin\" is strongly supported by the precontext (old violin in the attic) and the ending (playing melodies).  \n• The sentence \"They both decided to fiddle together\" logically follows the action of playing music, as the ending confirms they were playing melodies.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fiddle\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. avoid (one's assigned duties) (e.g., \"He decided to fiddle with his responsibilities.\")\n2. play the violin or fiddle (e.g., \"She loves to fiddle at night.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Rachel and Tom had been friends since childhood. They often found themselves overwhelmed by their daily responsibilities. One day, they came across an old violin in the attic.\nSentence containing the homonym: They both decided to fiddle together.\nEnding: As they played melodies that echoed through the attic, laughter and joy filled the air, reminding them of the carefree days of their youth.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Fiddle\" meaning \"to avoid responsibilities\" is implausible because the context involves finding a violin and playing music, not avoiding duties.  \n• \"Fiddle\" meaning \"to play the violin\" is strongly supported by the precontext (old violin in the attic) and the ending (playing melodies).  \n• The sentence \"They both decided to fiddle together\" logically follows the action of playing music, as the ending confirms they were playing melodies.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
