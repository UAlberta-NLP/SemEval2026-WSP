(usually followed by 'on' or 'for') in readiness (e.g., \"She was up on her studies.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The alarm rang, pulling him from his dreams. Rubbing his eyes, he glanced at the clock on the bedside table. The sun peeked through the curtains, hinting at a promising day ahead.\nSentence containing the homonym: He was up and eager to take on the day.\nEnding: With a happy strut, he entered the day with a smile, ready for action.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Up\" meaning \"out of bed\" is strongly supported by the precontext, which describes someone waking up from sleep and preparing for the day.  \n• \"Up\" meaning \"in readiness\" (e.g., \"up on her studies\") is less plausible here because the context emphasizes physical awakening, not academic preparedness.  \n• The sentence \"He was up and eager\" uses \"up\" in a way that aligns with physical readiness, not mental or academic readiness, and the ending reinforces his physical readiness to begin the day.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
