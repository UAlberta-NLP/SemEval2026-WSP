  "explanation": "• \"Dribbled\" referring to propelling a ball (e.g., dribbling a basketball) is plausible given the football context, though the sentence says \"dribbled all over the football pitch,\" which suggests movement, not saliva.  \n• \"Dribbled\" as salivation is inconsistent with the precontext of a hungry child and the physical setting—saliva would not \"dribble all over the pitch\" in a way that fits the narrative of hunger and focus.  \n• The phrase \"dribbled all over the football pitch\" strongly implies physical movement, not bodily fluid, making the ball-dribbling meaning more contextually grounded and natural.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: dribbled\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. propel, (e.g., \"He likes to dribble the basketball.\")\n2. let saliva drivel from the mouth (e.g., \"The baby began to dribble with joy.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jake loved football more than anything. He hadn't eaten much since breakfast and his stomach growled. As the game continued, he couldn't help but lose focus.\nSentence containing the homonym: The hungry child dribbled all over the football pitch.\nEnding: He was looking to play the best pass so he would impress the coach, but he just couldn't concentrate over his rumbling stomach.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Dribbled\" referring to propelling a ball (e.g., dribbling a basketball) is plausible given the football context, though the sentence says \"dribbled all over the football pitch,\" which suggests movement, not saliva.  \n• \"Dribbled\" as salivation is inconsistent with the precontext of a hungry child and the physical setting—saliva would not \"dribble all over the pitch\" in a way that fits the narrative of hunger and focus.  \n• The phrase \"dribbled all over the football pitch\" strongly implies physical movement, not bodily fluid, making the ball-dribbling meaning more contextually grounded and natural.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
