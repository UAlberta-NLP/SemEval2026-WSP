  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: rare\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (of meat) cooked a short time; still red inside (e.g., \"I prefer my steak cooked rare.\")\n2. recurring only at long intervals (e.g., \"A rare comet will pass by soon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emma loved food. She was excited to visit the annual food festival. There were dishes from all over the world.\nSentence containing the homonym: At the festival, she had a rare treat that she didn't come across very often.\nEnding: They usually overcook it, but the chef did it perfectly this time, all red and juicy inside.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext about Emma enjoying food and tasting dishes from around the world makes the culinary meaning (meat cooked rare) highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"rare treat\" is a common idiomatic expression meaning something uncommon or special, which aligns with meaning 2 (occurring infrequently), not a cooking style.  \n• The ending explicitly describes the dish as \"all red and juicy inside,\" directly supporting the interpretation of \"rare\" as referring to a steak cooked with red meat, confirming the culinary meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
