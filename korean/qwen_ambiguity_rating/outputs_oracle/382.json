He rubbed his eyes, trying to make sense of the strange shapes and colors. The images danced before him, indistinct and puzzling.\nSentence containing the homonym: Alex found it hard to clear his vision.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Alex seeing strange shapes and colors, suggesting a physical visual experience, making the sensory meaning of \"vision\" highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"clear his vision\" in this context logically refers to improving visual clarity, which aligns with the sense of \"the ability to see.\"  \n• The mental imagery sense (\"formation of a mental image\") is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of internal images or future concepts; the focus is on external visual stimuli.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
