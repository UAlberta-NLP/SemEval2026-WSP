  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: goal\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the state of affairs that a plan is intended to achieve and that (when achieved) terminates behavior intended to achieve it (e.g., \"Achieving your goal is essential for success.\")\n2. a successful attempt at scoring (e.g., \"She scored the winning goal yesterday.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The team had been training hard for months. Every player was focused on improving their skills on the field. The goalkeeper put in extra hours, determined to make a difference in the upcoming match.\nSentence containing the homonym: The goalkeeper had reached his goal.\nEnding: Everyone let out a big cheer and congratulated him for getting the ball in the net.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (the state of affairs a plan is intended to achieve) is plausible given the precontext, as the goalkeeper has been training hard and is focused on improving performance, suggesting personal or professional achievement.  \n• Meaning 2 (a successful attempt at scoring) is strongly supported by the ending, which explicitly states \"getting the ball in the net,\" directly linking the goal to a goal-scoring event.  \n• The precontext and ending together make meaning 2 far more contextually grounded and specific, while meaning 1 would be less directly supported by the action described.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
