  "explanation": "• The precontext describes a cafe setting where a waiter delivers a piece of paper, strongly suggesting a financial \"bill\" as the object being handed.  \n• The sentence \"The bill made contact with the table\" describes a physical object touching the table, which fits the bird's beak/bill as a body part, but this is inconsistent with the typical use of \"bill\" in a cafe context.  \n• The ending \"She paid it as quickly as she could\" confirms the financial transaction, clearly indicating the word refers to a payment statement, not a bird part.",

She absentmindedly watched as a few birds fluttered onto the nearby tables. A waiter approached her table, ready to deliver a piece of paper.\nSentence containing the homonym: The bill made contact with the table in a quick manner.\nEnding: She paid it as quickly as she could.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a cafe setting where a waiter delivers a piece of paper, strongly suggesting a financial \"bill\" as the object being handed.  \n• The sentence \"The bill made contact with the table\" describes a physical object touching the table, which fits the bird's beak/bill as a body part, but this is inconsistent with the typical use of \"bill\" in a cafe context.  \n• The ending \"She paid it as quickly as she could\" confirms the financial transaction, clearly indicating the word refers to a payment statement, not a bird part.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
