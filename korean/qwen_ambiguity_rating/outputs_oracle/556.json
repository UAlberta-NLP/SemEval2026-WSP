Every weekend, she would venture out to explore and discover new things. Her love for documenting each adventure grew with every trip she took.\nSentence containing the homonym: She enjoys her collection of logs.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Anna living near a forest and documenting her adventures, making a collection of tree logs (meaning 1) a plausible and contextually grounded interpretation.  \n• The term \"logs\" as a ship voyage record (meaning 2) is unrelated to the setting of forest exploration and personal adventure documentation, making it unlikely in this context.  \n• The phrase \"collection of logs\" naturally aligns with a physical collection of tree trunks, especially given Anna’s outdoor activities and interest in documenting her trips.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
