  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: drawing\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. represent by making a drawing of, as with a pencil, chalk, etc. on a surface (e.g., \"She will draw a beautiful landscape.\")\n2. direct toward itself or oneself by means of some psychological power or physical attributes (e.g., \"Her charisma can draw a crowd.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Adam often visited the town square. People gathered there every weekend for various events. He knew how to captivate the onlookers.\nSentence containing the homonym: Adam enjoyed drawing a crowd.\nEnding: It was amazing to see so many people with their attention on him.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Drawing a crowd\" in the context of Adam captivating onlookers aligns well with meaning 2 (directing people toward oneself through charisma)  \n• The precontext mentioning people gathering and Adam \"captivating\" onlookers strongly supports the psychological/behavioral sense of \"drawing\"  \n• Meaning 1 (making a drawing) is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of Adam creating visual art or sketching anything  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
