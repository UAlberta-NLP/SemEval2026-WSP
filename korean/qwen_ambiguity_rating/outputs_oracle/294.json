Adam was a regular customer and often talked about his business trips. One busy evening, he sat at one of her tables again.\nSentence containing the homonym: Anna was thrilled when she received a really good tip from Adam.\nEnding: The young man was given a tip before he did the job.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext establishes that Adam is a regular customer at a restaurant, making a monetary tip highly plausible in the sentence \"Anna was thrilled when she received a really good tip from Adam.\"  \n• The phrase \"a really good tip\" in a restaurant setting strongly aligns with meaning 1 (money given for services), as this is the standard usage in such contexts.  \n• The ending states \"The young man was given a tip before he did the job,\" which clearly refers to a piece of information (a tip about a job opportunity), suggesting that meaning 2 (indication of potential opportunity) is used in a different context and does not apply to Anna’s situation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
