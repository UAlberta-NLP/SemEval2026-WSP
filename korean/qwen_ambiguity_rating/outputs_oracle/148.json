  "explanation": "• The precontext establishes that Emily’s restaurant is located on Ridge Hill and is relocating to the valley, making a \"downhill\" move in location highly plausible.  \n• \"Gone downhill\" in the sentence refers to a decline in business or reputation, which aligns with meaning 1 (toward a lower or inferior state), not a physical location.  \n• The phrase \"gone downhill\" is a common idiom for deterioration, especially in business contexts, and the relocation to the valley does not imply a physical descent in the sense of terrain.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emily always loved the view from the top of Ridge Hill. Last year, she had opened her dream restaurant there, hoping to attract tourists. But, they recently decided to relocate to the valley.\nSentence containing the homonym: The restaurant has gone downhill since moving sites.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext establishes that Emily’s restaurant is located on Ridge Hill and is relocating to the valley, making a \"downhill\" move in location highly plausible.  \n• \"Gone downhill\" in the sentence refers to a decline in business or reputation, which aligns with meaning 1 (toward a lower or inferior state), not a physical location.  \n• The phrase \"gone downhill\" is a common idiom for deterioration, especially in business contexts, and the relocation to the valley does not imply a physical descent in the sense of terrain.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
