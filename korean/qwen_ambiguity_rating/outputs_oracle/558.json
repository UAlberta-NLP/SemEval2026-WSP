They planned to test the resilience of certain variables under stress. As the trial began, everyone was eager to observe the outcomes.\nSentence containing the homonym: The identities did not change, given the circumstances.\nEnding: Despite the pressure, the researchers observed that each subject remained true to its original.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (personal identity) is strongly supported by the context, as the sentence discusses subjects remaining \"true to their original\" and \"resilience under stress,\" suggesting stable individual characteristics.  \n• Meaning 2 (mathematical identity) is implausible, as the context involves scientific experimentation and human subjects, not abstract mathematical operations.  \n• The ending explicitly references \"each subject remaining true to its original,\" which aligns with personal identity and not a mathematical operator.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
