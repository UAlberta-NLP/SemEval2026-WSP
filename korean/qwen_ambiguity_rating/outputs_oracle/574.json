She had heard there was something new to see. People said it promised to be exciting.\nSentence containing the homonym: She watched the trailer carefully.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Anna driving to see something new and exciting, which strongly suggests she is observing a preview of a new attraction or movie.  \n• \"Trailer\" as a film preview fits naturally with the idea of watching something new before it's released.  \n• \"Trailer\" as a vehicle is inconsistent with the context, as Anna is already driving and would not be watching a trailer (vehicle) while traveling.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
