Adam was a regular customer and often talked about his business trips. One busy evening, he sat at one of her tables again.\nSentence containing the homonym: Anna was thrilled when she received a really good tip from Adam.\nEnding: Anna decided to go and buy shares in the company recommended by Adam.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext establishes that Adam is a regular customer at a restaurant, making a monetary tip from him highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"a really good tip\" in this context fits naturally with the financial meaning, as it aligns with common usage in service settings.  \n• The ending states that Anna bought shares based on a recommendation from Adam, which implies the \"tip\" in the sentence was not a monetary gift but an indication of a business opportunity.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
