  "explanation": "• The precontext describes Emily exploring \"the intricate network beneath her new home,\" which strongly supports the literal, geographical meaning of \"underground\" as subterranean structures.  \n• The phrase \"hidden mysteries\" in the precontext aligns with the idea of concealed systems, but the sentence \"The underground system is one of the best\" does not suggest a covert movement or secret organization.  \n• The term \"underground system\" in urban contexts (e.g., subway, metro) is a common, well-established phrase, and the precontext's focus on physical exploration of infrastructure makes this meaning dominant.",
