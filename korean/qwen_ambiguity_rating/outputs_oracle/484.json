He remembered the tales of wild animals in the woods. His friends insisted everyone bring only the essentials.\nSentence containing the homonym: He did bring a knife, but there was no point.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"there was no point\" in the context of bringing camping gear strongly suggests the meaning \"the object or purpose\" (meaning 1), as it refers to whether something has a purpose or justification.  \n• The meaning \"sharp end\" (meaning 2) is implausible here, as a knife’s sharp end is not typically referred to in this context, and there is no mention of a physical object with a point being absent.  \n• The precontext about bringing only essentials and Jack bringing a knife supports the idea that the sentence is evaluating the purpose or necessity of bringing the knife, not its physical tip.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
