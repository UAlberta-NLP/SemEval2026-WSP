  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emily always loved the view from the top of Ridge Hill. Last year, she had opened her dream restaurant there, hoping to attract tourists. But, they recently decided to relocate to the valley.\nSentence containing the homonym: The restaurant has gone downhill since moving sites.\nEnding: Fewer customers visited the new place, and the food quality wasn't as good as before.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (toward a lower or inferior state) is strongly supported by the context, as the restaurant's decline in customers and food quality directly aligns with a deterioration in status.  \n• Meaning 2 (toward the bottom of a hill) is implausible, as the context discusses a relocation from the top of Ridge Hill to the valley, not a physical descent along a hillside.  \n• The ending explicitly confirms a decline in performance, reinforcing the metaphorical sense of \"going downhill\" as a drop in quality and popularity.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
