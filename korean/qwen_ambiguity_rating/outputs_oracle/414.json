  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: croaked\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. pass from physical life and lose all bodily attributes and functions necessary to sustain life (e.g., \"He feared he might croak soon.\")\n2. make complaining remarks or noises under one's breath (e.g., \"She always croaks about her workload.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The boy returned home from school on a stormy day. He found his father sitting quietly in the dimly lit living room. Somehow, he seemed different as he stared into nothingness.\nSentence containing the homonym: The boy thought his father had croaked.\nEnding: He rushed and grabbed him, but he was just deep in thought.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (died) is highly plausible given the context of a stormy day, a father sitting quietly, and the boy fearing he might have died—this fits the emotional and situational tone of the scene.  \n• Meaning 2 (make complaining remarks) is inconsistent with the context, as the father is described as \"sitting quietly\" and \"deep in thought,\" not making under-breath complaints.  \n• The ending confirms the father is alive (\"He rushed and grabbed him\"), which rules out the death interpretation and makes the \"croaked\" meaning as \"died\" clearly correct.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
