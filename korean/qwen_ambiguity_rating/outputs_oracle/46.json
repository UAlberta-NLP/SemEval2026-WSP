  "explanation": "• The precontext mentions \"wondrous knowledge\" and \"flavors,\" suggesting both intellectual and culinary elements, making both meanings initially plausible.  \n• The sentence \"The sage was very bold\" fits naturally with a person (meaning 1) as a wise mentor, where boldness could refer to confidence in teaching or philosophy.  \n• The herb meaning (2) is less likely because herbs don’t typically \"be bold\" in a human-like sense; boldness as a trait is anthropomorphic and fits a person, not a plant.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: sage\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a mentor in spiritual and philosophical topics who is renowned for profound wisdom (e.g., \"The sage offered wise counsel to all.\")\n2. aromatic fresh or dried grey-green leaves used widely as seasoning for meats and fowl and game etc (e.g., \"I seasoned the chicken with sage.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: In the small village of Greendale, there was much talk about the new arrival. People often gathered to discuss what wondrous knowledge and flavors awaited them. Mrs. Thompson, the local baker, was particularly interested in what this could mean for her recipes.\nSentence containing the homonym: The sage was very bold.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions \"wondrous knowledge\" and \"flavors,\" suggesting both intellectual and culinary elements, making both meanings initially plausible.  \n• The sentence \"The sage was very bold\" fits naturally with a person (meaning 1) as a wise mentor, where boldness could refer to confidence in teaching or philosophy.  \n• The herb meaning (2) is less likely because herbs don’t typically \"be bold\" in a human-like sense; boldness as a trait is anthropomorphic and fits a person, not a plant.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
