  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: suits\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a set of garments (usually including a jacket and trousers or skirt) for outerwear all of the same fabric and color (e.g., \"He wore a tailored suit to the event.\")\n2. a comprehensive term for any proceeding in a court of law whereby an individual seeks a legal remedy (e.g., \"They filed a suit for damages.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jake was finally called in for his meeting. He sat in the waiting room, going over everything in his mind. The room was filled with murmurs and hushed conversations.\nSentence containing the homonym: The suits were interesting, to say the least.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a waiting room with murmurs and hushed conversations, suggesting a social or interpersonal setting where clothing-related descriptions are plausible.  \n• \"Suits\" as in clothing fits naturally in a scene where people are in a room, possibly dressed formally, and the sentence \"The suits were interesting\" could refer to the garments being stylish or well-designed.  \n• \"Suits\" as in legal proceedings does not fit the context—there is no mention of court, legal action, or formal complaints, and no indication of litigation or legal disputes.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
