  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: flexible\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. capable of being changed (e.g., \"She has a flexible work schedule.\")\n2. able to flex; able to bend easily (e.g., \"The flexible branches swayed in the breeze.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Anna had always been adaptable in her work. She had spent years perfecting the art of adjusting to any situation. When the theater announced auditions for the lead role in the new play, she decided to give it a shot.\nSentence containing the homonym: They chose her for the role because she was incredibly flexible.\nEnding: The play would require her to play three different characters, including an old lady, an eight-year-old orphan, and a pregnant cat.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes Anna's adaptability and ability to adjust to different situations, strongly supporting the meaning of \"capable of being changed\" (meaning 1).  \n• The phrase \"flexible\" in the sentence directly follows a description of adaptability, making the behavioral/adjustive sense highly contextually grounded.  \n• The ending, which mentions playing multiple roles (including an old lady, an eight-year-old, and a pregnant cat), suggests a need for range and versatility, not physical bendability, ruling out the physical \"able to bend\" meaning (meaning 2).  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
