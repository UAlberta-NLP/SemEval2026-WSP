They both needed time away from the hustle of the city. After packing their bags, they were finally on their way.\nSentence containing the homonym: The couple went to their reservation.\nEnding: The cottage was very nice, with scenic views.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (a district reserved for a purpose) is plausible, as the couple is traveling to a location, and \"reservation\" could refer to a tribal or geographical area.  \n• Meaning 2 (the act of reserving a place) is less plausible, as the sentence says \"went to their reservation,\" not \"made a reservation,\" and there is no mention of booking a meal or service.  \n• The ending mentioning \"the cottage\" supports the idea of a physical location, which aligns better with a geographical reservation than a booking.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
