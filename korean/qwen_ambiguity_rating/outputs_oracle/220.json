  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: draw\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. bring, take, or pull out of a container or from under a cover (e.g., \"He will draw a knife swiftly.\")\n2. represent by making a drawing of, as with a pencil, chalk, etc. on a surface (e.g., \"She will draw a beautiful landscape.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Mark reached into his backpack and felt around. He found the small object he'd been searching for. A smile spread across his face as he imagined its potential.\nSentence containing the homonym: Mark believed he could draw it very quickly.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Mark reaching into his backpack and finding an object, suggesting a physical action of retrieving something from a container.  \n• \"Draw\" in the sentence \"Mark believed he could draw it very quickly\" logically follows the first meaning (to pull out or take from a container), as he is trying to retrieve the object.  \n• The second meaning (to make a drawing) is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of drawing, art, or visual representation, and the object is already found.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
