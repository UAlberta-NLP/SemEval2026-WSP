  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pick\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. select carefully from a group (e.g., \"She had to pick a winner.\")\n2. pull lightly but sharply with a plucking motion (e.g., \"She will pick a string gently.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emily and Jack sat in the garden, surrounded by the bright blooms of spring. In front of Emily lay a box of colorful marbles and a banjo. The air was filled with anticipation as she contemplated her next move.\nSentence containing the homonym: He didn't know what she was going to pick.\nEnding: She chose to play the banjo.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Pick a winner\" from meaning 1 (select carefully) is supported by the context, as Emily is contemplating her next move among colorful marbles and a banjo, suggesting a choice between options.  \n• Meaning 2 (pull lightly with a plucking motion) is not supported, as there is no indication of plucking strings or any physical action involving a string in the context.  \n• The ending confirms that Emily chose to play the banjo, indicating a decision-making action, which aligns with \"select\" rather than \"pluck\" as a physical motion.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
