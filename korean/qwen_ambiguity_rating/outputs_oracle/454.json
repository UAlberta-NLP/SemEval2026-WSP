  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: bill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an itemized statement of money owed for goods shipped or services rendered (e.g., \"She received the bill yesterday.\")\n2. horny projecting mouth of a bird (e.g., \"The bird used its bill to forage.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Emma sat at the quaint corner cafe, enjoying her afternoon tea. She absentmindedly watched as a few birds fluttered onto the nearby tables. A waiter approached her table, ready to deliver a piece of paper.\nSentence containing the homonym: The bill made contact with the table in a quick manner.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a cafe setting with birds and a waiter, making a financial \"bill\" (meaning 1) highly plausible as the waiter delivers a payment statement.  \n• The phrase \"the bill made contact with the table\" literally refers to a physical object, and birds are described as using their \"bills,\" suggesting the word \"bill\" is being used in the biological sense (meaning 2).  \n• However, \"bill\" as a bird part is not typically used in a physical contact action like \"making contact with the table\"; it would be odd to say a bird's beak \"made contact\" in this context, especially when the waiter is delivering a paper.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
