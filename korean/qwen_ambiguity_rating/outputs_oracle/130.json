  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n2. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John had set out on his morning run with high hopes. The path led him through the park, past the towering trees and lush hills. As he picked up speed, he could feel a change in the air.\nSentence containing the homonym: Things were going downhill.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Things going downhill\" fits naturally with meaning 2 (toward a lower or inferior state), as the precontext describes John's run and a change in the air, suggesting a decline in his physical or emotional state.  \n• Meaning 1 (toward the bottom of a hill) is less plausible because the sentence does not mention physical movement, terrain, or a path descending a hill, and the context focuses on emotional or situational change, not geography.  \n• The precontext sets up a narrative of a morning run with \"high hopes,\" making a decline in well-being (meaning 2) a more coherent and emotionally grounded interpretation than a literal descent in terrain.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
