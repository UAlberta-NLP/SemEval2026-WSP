  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pile\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the yarn (as in a rug or velvet or corduroy) that stands up from the weave (e.g., \"The rug's pile is soft and lush.\")\n2. a large sum of money (especially as pay or profit) (e.g., \"He earned a nice pile selling stocks.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The factory was bustling with activity. Workers were focused on their tasks, hoping for a generous bonus. The manager had announced that the finishing area needed to be cleared by noon.\nSentence containing the homonym: The workers moved the pile quickly to clear the area.\nEnding: The rugs now gone, no one would trip in the rush.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes workers moving objects to clear a factory area, which strongly suggests physical movement of material, making \"pile\" as in a stack of items plausible.  \n• \"Pile\" as a large sum of money does not fit the context, as workers are not discussing financial rewards or bonuses in the action of moving objects.  \n• The ending mentions \"the rugs now gone,\" directly linking \"pile\" to the physical material (rugs), confirming the textile meaning and ruling out the financial interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
