  "explanation": "• The precontext about John’s biking adventure and the decline in market stalls strongly supports a decline in the market’s condition, aligning with meaning 1 (toward a lower or inferior state).  \n• Meaning 2 (toward the bottom of a hill) is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of physical terrain or a hill in the market’s location or John’s route.  \n• The phrase \"the market has been downhill lately\" is a common idiomatic expression for deterioration, not a literal description of the market’s geographical position.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John started a biking adventure last month. He rides past the local marketplace on his favorite track. Recently, people have noticed fewer stalls on his route.\nSentence containing the homonym: The market has been downhill lately, and this is really affecting John.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext about John’s biking adventure and the decline in market stalls strongly supports a decline in the market’s condition, aligning with meaning 1 (toward a lower or inferior state).  \n• Meaning 2 (toward the bottom of a hill) is inconsistent with the context, as there is no mention of physical terrain or a hill in the market’s location or John’s route.  \n• The phrase \"the market has been downhill lately\" is a common idiomatic expression for deterioration, not a literal description of the market’s geographical position.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
