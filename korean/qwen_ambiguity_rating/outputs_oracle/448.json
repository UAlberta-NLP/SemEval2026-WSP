  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: rare\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (of meat) cooked a short time; still red inside (e.g., \"I prefer my steak cooked rare.\")\n2. recurring only at long intervals (e.g., \"A rare comet will pass by soon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jack had always dreamed of tasting something unusual. He spent years traveling to distant lands for unique flavors. Finally, he found himself sitting in a renowned restaurant known for its extraordinary dishes.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had waited a long time to have this rare beef.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes Jack's quest for \"unusual\" and \"unique flavors,\" suggesting a focus on food experiences, making the culinary meaning of \"rare\" (cooked briefly, still red) highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"rare beef\" is a common culinary expression, and the context of a restaurant serving \"extraordinary dishes\" supports this interpretation.  \n• The second meaning (\"recurring only at long intervals\") would apply to events or phenomena, not to a type of meat, and there is no mention of comets, celestial events, or infrequent occurrences in the context.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
