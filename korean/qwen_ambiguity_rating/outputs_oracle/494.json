  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: plant\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an actor situated in the audience whose acting is rehearsed but seems spontaneous to the audience (e.g., \"The comedian used a plant in the crowd.\")\n2. (botany) a living organism lacking the power of locomotion (e.g., \"The garden has a beautiful plant.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom was eager to blend in at the comedy show. He settled into one of the middle rows of the theater, trying not to draw attention. The large venue was buzzing with anticipation as people took their seats.\nSentence containing the homonym: The guy in the crowd appeared to be next to a plant.\nEnding: Unfortunately, he was allergic to it, and he sneezed at the most inopportune moment of the whole show.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a comedy show setting with audience members, making the \"actor in the audience\" meaning highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"next to a plant\" in a crowd setting fits naturally with the first meaning, as \"plant\" as a person is a known theatrical term.  \n• The ending mentions an allergy to \"it\" and a sneeze, which strongly supports the botanical meaning (a plant as a living organism), contradicting the idea of a person in the crowd.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
