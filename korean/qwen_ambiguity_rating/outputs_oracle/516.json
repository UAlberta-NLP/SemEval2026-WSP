  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pictured\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. imagine; conceive of; see in one's mind (e.g., \"I can picture our future together.\")\n2. show in, or as in, a picture (e.g., \"The mural will picture a peaceful landscape.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom sat quietly in the gallery. He studied the portraits on the walls, admiring their detail. Each face told a different story, sparking his imagination.\nSentence containing the homonym: He pictured all of them together.\nEnding: And thought it would make a whole lot of sense.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (imagine/conceive) is strongly supported by the precontext, which mentions \"sparking his imagination\" and \"thought it would make a whole lot of sense,\" indicating mental visualization.  \n• Meaning 2 (show in a picture) is inconsistent with the context, as the sentence refers to \"all of them together\" in a mental or narrative sense, not as visual depictions of portraits.  \n• The ending, which focuses on \"thought it would make a whole lot of sense,\" reinforces the mental, imaginative interpretation rather than a literal visual representation.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
