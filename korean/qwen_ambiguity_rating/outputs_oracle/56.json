  "explanation": "• The precontext describes John attending meetings, which strongly suggests a connection to professional or legal activities, making the legal meaning (proceeding in court) plausible.  \n• \"Many suits\" in the context of clothing would be unusual given the precontext, as it would imply a large number of garments, which is not supported by the narrative about meetings or struggles.  \n• The ending mentions \"clearing his name and getting justice,\" which directly supports the legal meaning of \"suit\" as a legal proceeding, reinforcing that meaning.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: suits\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a set of garments (usually including a jacket and trousers or skirt) for outerwear all of the same fabric and color (e.g., \"He wore a tailored suit to the event.\")\n2. a comprehensive term for any proceeding in a court of law whereby an individual seeks a legal remedy (e.g., \"They filed a suit for damages.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John struggled through a tough year. Every week seemed to bring a new challenge. He found himself constantly attending meetings downtown.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had many suits last year.\nEnding: It was tiring for him, but he was determined to clear his name and get justice.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes John attending meetings, which strongly suggests a connection to professional or legal activities, making the legal meaning (proceeding in court) plausible.  \n• \"Many suits\" in the context of clothing would be unusual given the precontext, as it would imply a large number of garments, which is not supported by the narrative about meetings or struggles.  \n• The ending mentions \"clearing his name and getting justice,\" which directly supports the legal meaning of \"suit\" as a legal proceeding, reinforcing that meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
