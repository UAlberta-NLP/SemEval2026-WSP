  "explanation": "• The mention of a \"market\" with \"colorful sights and sounds\" strongly suggests a visual, tangible object like a fruit, making the fruit meaning highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"that peach over there\" fits naturally as a reference to a visible object (e.g., a fruit or food item) in a market setting.  \n• The meaning of \"a very attractive woman\" is unlikely here, as no description of a person's appearance or attractiveness is provided, and such a reference would be out of place without explicit context or a person being described.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: peach\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. downy juicy fruit with sweet yellowish or whitish flesh (e.g., \"She enjoyed a ripe peach for dessert.\")\n2. a very attractive or seductive looking woman (e.g., \"She was a knockout at the party.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: She wandered through the busy market. Stalls lined the street, filled with colorful sights and sounds. Her gaze drifted, catching various things and people.\nSentence containing the homonym: That peach over there is grabbing her attention.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The mention of a \"market\" with \"colorful sights and sounds\" strongly suggests a visual, tangible object like a fruit, making the fruit meaning highly plausible.  \n• The phrase \"that peach over there\" fits naturally as a reference to a visible object (e.g., a fruit or food item) in a market setting.  \n• The meaning of \"a very attractive woman\" is unlikely here, as no description of a person's appearance or attractiveness is provided, and such a reference would be out of place without explicit context or a person being described.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
