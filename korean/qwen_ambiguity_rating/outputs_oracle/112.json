  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: reservations\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an unstated doubt that prevents you from accepting something wholeheartedly (e.g., \"She accepted the offer with some reservation.\")\n2. the act of reserving (a place or passage) or engaging the services of (a person or group) (e.g., \"I made a reservation for dinner.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: James sat quietly on the bus, thinking about the meeting he had later. He wondered if everything was in place for the trip he had planned afterward. As more passengers boarded, a man chose to sit beside him.\nSentence containing the homonym: The guy on the bus told him about his reservations.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes James thinking about a meeting and trip, and a man sitting beside him, suggesting a social or personal interaction—making emotional hesitation (\"reservations\" as doubt) plausible.  \n• \"Reservations\" as in booking a seat on the bus is not supported by the text, as no mention is made of seating, dining, or prior arrangements.  \n• The phrase \"told him about his reservations\" fits naturally with a personal, internal state (doubt) rather than a booking, given the lack of logistical or service-related cues.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
