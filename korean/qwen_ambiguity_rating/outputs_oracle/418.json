  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: croaked\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. pass from physical life and lose all bodily attributes and functions necessary to sustain life (e.g., \"He feared he might croak soon.\")\n2. make complaining remarks or noises under one's breath (e.g., \"She always croaks about her workload.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The boy returned home from school on a stormy day. He found his father sitting quietly in the dimly lit living room. Somehow, he seemed different as he stared into nothingness.\nSentence containing the homonym: The boy thought his father had croaked.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes the father as \"sitting quietly\" and \"staring into nothingness,\" which strongly suggests a state of death or absence of life, making meaning 1 highly plausible.  \n• Meaning 2 (making complaining noises) is inconsistent with the tone and setting; the father is described as quiet and withdrawn, not making under-breath complaints.  \n• The sentence \"his father had croaked\" is a common idiom for death in such narrative contexts, especially with the stormy day and emotional tone, further supporting meaning 1.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
