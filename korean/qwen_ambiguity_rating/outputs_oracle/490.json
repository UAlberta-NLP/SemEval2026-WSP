  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: point\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. sharp end (e.g., \"He carefully carved the point of the stick.\")\n2. a brief version of the essential meaning of something (e.g., \"Make your point clearly and concisely.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The campers sat in a circle around the dwindling fire. Tom and Lily exchanged nervous glances, clutching their trek poles tightly. In the dim light, shadows danced on the forest floor.\nSentence containing the homonym: They tried their hardest to avoid the point.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Point\" as a sharp end is unlikely, as the context involves campers, shadows, and trek poles—no physical object with a sharp tip is mentioned or implied.  \n• \"Point\" as a brief version of the essential meaning fits well, as the sentence \"avoid the point\" logically means avoiding the core issue or truth of a situation, such as a tense or potentially dangerous situation.  \n• The precontext, with nervous glances and a dwindling fire, suggests emotional tension and unspoken conflict, making the abstract meaning of \"point\" (essence or truth) far more plausible than a physical point.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
