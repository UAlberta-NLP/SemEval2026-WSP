  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fiddling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. avoid (one's assigned duties) (e.g., \"He decided to fiddle with his responsibilities.\")\n2. play the violin or fiddle (e.g., \"She loves to fiddle at night.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The meeting started promptly at nine. Everyone in the room was expected to contribute. Yet, some were clearly distracted.\nSentence containing the homonym: Can they stop fiddling? It's really irritating and annoying.\nEnding: Feet were tapping, hands twitching, and tongues clicking in a frenzied whirl of impatience.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Fiddling\" as avoiding duties fits the context of distraction and impatience in a meeting, where people are not contributing.  \n• \"Fiddling\" as playing the violin is inconsistent with the context, as no musical activity is mentioned or implied.  \n• The ending describing physical restlessness (tapping, twitching) supports the idea of distraction or avoidance, not musical activity.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
