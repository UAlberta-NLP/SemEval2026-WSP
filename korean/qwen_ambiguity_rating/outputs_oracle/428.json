  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pile\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the yarn (as in a rug or velvet or corduroy) that stands up from the weave (e.g., \"The rug's pile is soft and lush.\")\n2. a large sum of money (especially as pay or profit) (e.g., \"He earned a nice pile selling stocks.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The factory was bustling with activity. Workers were focused on their tasks, hoping for a generous bonus. The manager had announced that the finishing area needed to be cleared by noon.\nSentence containing the homonym: The workers moved the pile quickly to clear the area.\nEnding: The rubbish was cleared, and the team had a great night afterwards.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes workers moving objects to clear a space, making a physical pile of rubbish highly plausible  \n• \"Pile\" as a large sum of money does not fit the context of workers physically moving materials; it would be odd to say they moved \"a pile\" of money  \n• The ending confirms the clearing of rubbish, supporting the interpretation of \"pile\" as a physical accumulation of waste  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
