Today was different; he had an important meeting. There was something unsettling about the day ahead.\nSentence containing the homonym: The suit made him angry.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"the suit made him angry\" is more likely to refer to a legal proceeding, as emotional reactions to legal actions (e.g., being sued) are common and contextually supported by the precontext of an important meeting.  \n• The meaning \"a set of garments\" would be odd in this context, as clothing typically does not \"make someone angry\" in a literal or psychological sense without further explanation.  \n• The precontext involving an important meeting and an unsettling day suggests a potential legal conflict, making the legal meaning more plausible than the clothing meaning.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
