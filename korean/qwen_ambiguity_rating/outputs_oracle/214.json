In her hand, she held a small sketchpad and a pack of cigarettes. Her fingers danced nervously as she contemplated her next move.\nSentence containing the homonym: Sheila was about to draw on the cigarette.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Draw\" as in \"make a drawing\" is supported by the precontext, which mentions Sheila holding a sketchpad and contemplating her next move—suggesting artistic activity.  \n• \"Draw\" as in \"suck in air\" is not supported by the context; there is no indication of inhalation or breath control, and no physical or situational cues for drawing breath.  \n• The phrase \"draw on the cigarette\" is a common idiom meaning to smoke or inhale, which is plausible in the context of someone holding cigarettes and contemplating their next move.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
