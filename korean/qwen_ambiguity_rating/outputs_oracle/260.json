  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: try\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. make an effort or attempt (e.g., \"She will try to finish on time.\")\n2. put on trial or hear a case and sit as the judge at the trial of (e.g., \"The judge will try the case tomorrow.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John had faced challenges in his career before. Each time, he approached them with determination. Now he stood before yet another one.\nSentence containing the homonym: This will be his third try.\nEnding: This may be a harder case to judge than he thought.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Try\" as \"make an effort\" is strongly supported by the precontext, which emphasizes John's determination and repeated attempts in his career.  \n• \"Try\" as \"hear a case\" is not supported by the context, as the narrative focuses on John's career challenges, not legal proceedings or judicial roles.  \n• The ending mentions \"a harder case to judge,\" which indirectly reinforces the legal meaning, but this is a misalignment—John is not a judge, and \"case\" here refers to career challenges, not a legal trial.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
