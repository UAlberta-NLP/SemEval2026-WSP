  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: pile\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the yarn (as in a rug or velvet or corduroy) that stands up from the weave (e.g., \"The rug's pile is soft and lush.\")\n2. a large sum of money (especially as pay or profit) (e.g., \"He earned a nice pile selling stocks.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: James walked into the room, his eyes scanning the space carefully. On the table in the center lay a large, old book, surrounded by scattered papers. He approached it slowly, feeling a sense of anticipation.\nSentence containing the homonym: There was a good pile on it.\nEnding: He ran his hands across it, enjoying the feeling.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The phrase \"a good pile on it\" refers to a large amount of material (papers) surrounding the book, matching meaning 1 (a pile of papers)  \n• The context describes scattered papers and a physical object being touched, supporting a literal, physical accumulation  \n• \"A good pile of money\" would imply financial gain, which is not supported by the precontext or the ending describing tactile interaction  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
