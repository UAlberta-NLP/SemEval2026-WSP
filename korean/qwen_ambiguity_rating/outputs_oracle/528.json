  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: goal\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the state of affairs that a plan is intended to achieve and that (when achieved) terminates behavior intended to achieve it (e.g., \"Achieving your goal is essential for success.\")\n2. a successful attempt at scoring (e.g., \"She scored the winning goal yesterday.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The team had been training hard for months. Every player was focused on improving their skills on the field. The goalkeeper put in extra hours, determined to make a difference in the upcoming match.\nSentence containing the homonym: The goalkeeper had reached his goal.\nEnding: Impressing the England manager with his acrobatic saves, Billy was confident he'd be picked for the World Cup.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (the state of affairs a plan is intended to achieve) is plausible, as the goalkeeper has been training hard and is focused on improving performance, suggesting a personal or professional objective.  \n• Meaning 2 (a successful attempt at scoring) is contextually unlikely, as the goalkeeper is described as making saves, not scoring goals, and the sentence emphasizes acrobatic saves, not goals scored.  \n• The precontext and ending both support a focus on performance and saves, making the personal \"goal\" (meaning 1) the only coherent interpretation.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
