  "explanation": "• The precontext mentions Anna driving to see something new and exciting, which strongly suggests she is observing a preview of a movie.  \n• \"She watched the trailer carefully\" uses the verb \"watched,\" which is typical for viewing a film trailer, not a vehicle.  \n• The ending states \"As it passed by, she saw what was inside,\" which implies a physical object being observed in motion, consistent with a trailer as a vehicle, not a film preview.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: trailer\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an advertisement consisting of short scenes from a motion picture that will appear in the near future (e.g., \"I watched the new movie trailer online.\")\n2. a wheeled vehicle that can be pulled by a car or truck and is equipped for occupancy (e.g., \"They traveled cross-country in their trailer.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Anna drove to the edge of town. She had heard there was something new to see. People said it promised to be exciting.\nSentence containing the homonym: She watched the trailer carefully.\nEnding: As it passed by, she saw what was inside.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions Anna driving to see something new and exciting, which strongly suggests she is observing a preview of a movie.  \n• \"She watched the trailer carefully\" uses the verb \"watched,\" which is typical for viewing a film trailer, not a vehicle.  \n• The ending states \"As it passed by, she saw what was inside,\" which implies a physical object being observed in motion, consistent with a trailer as a vehicle, not a film preview.  \n\nJUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS"
