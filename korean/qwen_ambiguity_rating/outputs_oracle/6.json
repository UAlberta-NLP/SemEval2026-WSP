  "explanation": "• \"Dribbling\" referring to moving the soccer ball with feet fits perfectly with the precontext of Tommy preparing to play and the ending mentioning maneuvering the ball.  \n• The alternative meaning (saliva dripping) is inconsistent with the context of a child excitedly playing soccer and does not align with the physical activity described.  \n• There is no indication of Tommy drooling or oral secretions, and the surrounding narrative focuses on physical movement and sports activity.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: dribbling\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. propel, (e.g., \"He likes to dribble the basketball.\")\n2. let saliva drivel from the mouth (e.g., \"The baby began to dribble with joy.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tommy was excited as he headed to the park with his dad. He carried his soccer ball tightly under his arm. They found a spot near the benches and prepared for some fun.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had been dribbling constantly.\nEnding: Tommy looked forward to showing off his ability to maneuver the ball with his feet.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Dribbling\" referring to moving the soccer ball with feet fits perfectly with the precontext of Tommy preparing to play and the ending mentioning maneuvering the ball.  \n• The alternative meaning (saliva dripping) is inconsistent with the context of a child excitedly playing soccer and does not align with the physical activity described.  \n• There is no indication of Tommy drooling or oral secretions, and the surrounding narrative focuses on physical movement and sports activity.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
