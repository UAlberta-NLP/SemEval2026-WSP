  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: point\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. sharp end (e.g., \"He carefully carved the point of the stick.\")\n2. a brief version of the essential meaning of something (e.g., \"Make your point clearly and concisely.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John was always a bit of a daydreamer. He often got lost in his own world, doodling shapes and scribbles. His friends watched, waiting for him to say something.\nSentence containing the homonym: He took a long time to reach the point.\nEnding: As a result, his audience lost interest.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Point\" as a sharp end is inconsistent with the context of John doodling and taking time to \"reach a point\" in a conversation.  \n• \"Point\" as a brief version of the essential meaning fits the context of John being a daydreamer who struggles to express himself clearly.  \n• The ending, where the audience loses interest due to John's delay, strongly supports the interpretation of \"reaching the point\" as understanding or conveying his main idea.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
