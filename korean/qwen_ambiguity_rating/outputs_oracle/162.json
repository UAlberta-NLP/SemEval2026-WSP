Every day, she explored different parts to understand its hidden mysteries.\nSentence containing the homonym: The underground system is one of the best.\nEnding: Every day, the Tube system sped people from home to work while above them, the city throbbed.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes Emily exploring \"the intricate network beneath her new home,\" which strongly suggests a physical, subterranean system.  \n• The sentence \"The underground system is one of the best\" follows naturally from the previous discussion of physical infrastructure, aligning with meaning 1 (underground as beneath the ground).  \n• Meaning 2 (hidden aims or methods) is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of secret movements, political aims, or hidden intentions.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
