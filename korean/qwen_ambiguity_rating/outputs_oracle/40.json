Two groups of students took part in the experiment last week. Each group had very different reactions to the procedure.\nSentence containing the homonym: The results of the test were higher in the mean cohort.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Mean\" as in \"approximating the statistical norm\" is supported by the precontext discussing test scores and group reactions, where \"mean cohort\" likely refers to average performance.  \n• \"Mean\" as in \"characterized by malice\" does not fit the context, as there is no indication of hostility or negative emotion toward students or the procedure.  \n• The phrase \"higher in the mean cohort\" uses \"mean\" in a statistical sense, consistent with academic research contexts and standard usage in scientific writing.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
