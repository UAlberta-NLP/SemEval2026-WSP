  "explanation": "• Making a snorting sound fits naturally in the context of someone physically reacting to a loud noise in a quiet room after a wild party.  \n• Inhaling drugs is not supported by the precontext, which describes exhaustion and a chaotic party but offers no hint of drug use or illicit activity.  \n• The sentence \"He snorted and heard a loud noise from outside\" suggests a physical sound reaction, not drug use, as the action is immediately followed by auditory perception.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: snorted\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. make a snorting sound by exhaling hard (e.g., \"He snorted in disbelief at the news.\")\n2. inhale recreational drugs (e.g., \"He was caught snorting powder in the bathroom.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Tom stumbled into the dimly lit room, his head spinning from exhaustion. The party had been wild, and the music still echoed in his mind. He leaned against the wall, trying to steady himself in the quiet that followed.\nSentence containing the homonym: He snorted and heard a loud noise from outside.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Making a snorting sound fits naturally in the context of someone physically reacting to a loud noise in a quiet room after a wild party.  \n• Inhaling drugs is not supported by the precontext, which describes exhaustion and a chaotic party but offers no hint of drug use or illicit activity.  \n• The sentence \"He snorted and heard a loud noise from outside\" suggests a physical sound reaction, not drug use, as the action is immediately followed by auditory perception.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
