  "explanation": "• The precontext mentions \"wondrous knowledge\" and \"flavors,\" suggesting a focus on both intellectual and culinary aspects, making both meanings initially plausible.  \n• The sentence \"The sage was very bold\" fits better with meaning 1 (a wise mentor) because \"bold\" is a trait often associated with philosophical or spiritual figures, not typical of herbs.  \n• The ending emphasizes \"spices\" and \"smells,\" which supports the culinary interpretation, but the sentence itself (\"The sage was very bold\") does not align naturally with a herb, as herbs don’t typically exhibit traits like \"boldness\" in a person-like sense.",

People often gathered to discuss what wondrous knowledge and flavors awaited them. Mrs. Thompson, the local baker, was particularly interested in what this could mean for her recipes.\nSentence containing the homonym: The sage was very bold.\nEnding: As well as the other spices around, the smells were amazing.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext mentions \"wondrous knowledge\" and \"flavors,\" suggesting a focus on both intellectual and culinary aspects, making both meanings initially plausible.  \n• The sentence \"The sage was very bold\" fits better with meaning 1 (a wise mentor) because \"bold\" is a trait often associated with philosophical or spiritual figures, not typical of herbs.  \n• The ending emphasizes \"spices\" and \"smells,\" which supports the culinary interpretation, but the sentence itself (\"The sage was very bold\") does not align naturally with a herb, as herbs don’t typically exhibit traits like \"boldness\" in a person-like sense.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
