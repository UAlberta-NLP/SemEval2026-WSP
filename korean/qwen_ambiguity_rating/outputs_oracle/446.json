  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: rare\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. (of meat) cooked a short time; still red inside (e.g., \"I prefer my steak cooked rare.\")\n2. recurring only at long intervals (e.g., \"A rare comet will pass by soon.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jack had always dreamed of tasting something unusual. He spent years traveling to distant lands for unique flavors. Finally, he found himself sitting in a renowned restaurant known for its extraordinary dishes.\nSentence containing the homonym: He had waited a long time to have this rare beef.\nEnding: It was cooked to medium and worth the pretty penny he paid for it.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext emphasizes \"unusual flavors\" and \"extraordinary dishes,\" making a culinary meaning of \"rare\" (as in rare meat) highly plausible.  \n• The sentence specifies \"rare beef,\" which directly links to the meat sense of \"rare,\" not a rare event, and the ending confirms the dish was cooked to medium, contradicting a \"rare\" (as in infrequent) interpretation.  \n• The meaning of \"rare\" as \"occurring infrequently\" (e.g., a rare comet) is inconsistent with the context of a dish being served and the specific mention of \"beef\" and cooking level.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
