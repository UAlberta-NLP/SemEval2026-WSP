  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: tips\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a relatively small amount of money given for services rendered (as by a waiter) (e.g., \"I left a generous tip for dinner.\")\n2. an indication of potential opportunity (e.g., \"He received a tip about the stock.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: John had just moved to the city and was trying out the neighborhood's restaurants. That evening, he decided to visit a small Italian place around the corner. The food was delicious, and the service was friendly and attentive.\nSentence containing the homonym: After the meal, he shared some valued tips with the waiter.\nEnding: The look on the waiter's face was incredible gratitude when he received the money.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes John leaving a restaurant with good service, and the sentence follows a meal, making a monetary tip highly plausible.  \n• \"Tips\" as in \"indication of potential opportunity\" does not fit the context, as there is no mention of stock, secrets, or hidden information.  \n• The ending explicitly states that the waiter received \"money,\" which confirms the monetary interpretation and rules out the non-monetary sense.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
