  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: reservations\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. an unstated doubt that prevents you from accepting something wholeheartedly (e.g., \"She accepted the offer with some reservation.\")\n2. the act of reserving (a place or passage) or engaging the services of (a person or group) (e.g., \"I made a reservation for dinner.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: James sat quietly on the bus, thinking about the meeting he had later. He wondered if everything was in place for the trip he had planned afterward. As more passengers boarded, a man chose to sit beside him.\nSentence containing the homonym: The guy on the bus told him about his reservations.\nEnding: He was interested to hear that the man had booked at the exact restaurant where he himself had eaten last night.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• Meaning 1 (unstated doubt) is implausible because the sentence \"The guy on the bus told him about his reservations\" does not suggest hesitation or doubt about accepting something; the context involves a conversation about a booking.  \n• Meaning 2 (reserving a place or service) is strongly supported by the ending, which confirms the man \"had booked at the exact restaurant,\" directly linking \"reservations\" to a booking.  \n• The precontext and ending together make the booking interpretation clear and specific, while the doubt interpretation lacks any textual or logical support.  \nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
