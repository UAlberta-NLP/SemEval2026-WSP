  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: downhill\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. toward a lower or inferior state (e.g., \"His health has been going downhill lately.\")\n2. toward the bottom of a hill (e.g., \"The bike raced downhill with speed.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The kids decided to build a soapbox car. They worked hard all afternoon, excited to race it on the steep hill by their street. As they lined it up at the top, they laughed and cheered in anticipation.\nSentence containing the homonym: They didn't realize how fast it would all go downhill.\nEnding: (none)\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a physical hill and a race, making the literal \"downhill\" as a direction of movement highly plausible.  \n• The sentence \"it would all go downhill\" follows naturally from the setup of a soapbox car racing down a steep hill, suggesting a physical descent.  \n• The metaphorical meaning (\"toward a lower state\") is not supported by the context, as there is no mention of health, decline, or emotional state.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
