  "explanation": "• \"Up\" referring to getting out of bed fits the precontext of staying up late and preparing for an early exam, with the timeline supporting waking up by 6 a.m.  \n• \"Up on her studies\" would imply readiness in a subject area, but the context emphasizes physical preparation (eating breakfast, drying clothes), not academic readiness.  \n• The ending describes physical morning activities (eggs, bacon, drying clothes), which aligns with being physically awake and active, not with being \"up on studies\" in a cognitive sense.",

  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: up\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. out of bed (e.g., \"Get up and start your day.\")\n2. (usually followed by 'on' or 'for') in readiness (e.g., \"She was up on her studies.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Lily had stayed up late the night before, going over her notes one last time. She knew how important this exam was for her future. Her alarm was set for early in the morning to give her plenty of time to prepare.\nSentence containing the homonym: By 6 a.m., she was already up and ready for the big exam.\nEnding: She started her day with eggs, bacon, and toast while drying her shirt by the heater.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• \"Up\" referring to getting out of bed fits the precontext of staying up late and preparing for an early exam, with the timeline supporting waking up by 6 a.m.  \n• \"Up on her studies\" would imply readiness in a subject area, but the context emphasizes physical preparation (eating breakfast, drying clothes), not academic readiness.  \n• The ending describes physical morning activities (eggs, bacon, drying clothes), which aligns with being physically awake and active, not with being \"up on studies\" in a cognitive sense.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
