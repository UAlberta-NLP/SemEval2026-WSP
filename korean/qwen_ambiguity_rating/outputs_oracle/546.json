  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: log\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. a segment of the trunk of a tree when stripped of branches (e.g., \"The firewood was made from a log.\")\n2. a written record of events on a voyage (of a ship or plane) (e.g., \"The captain maintained a detailed log.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: The siblings spent their summer exploring the beach. They often searched for interesting things that washed ashore. One day, they stumbled upon something curious hidden in the sand.\nSentence containing the homonym: They discovered an old log near the shore that revealed a lot about the past.\nEnding: This is because it had so many rings on it, showing it was more than 200 years old.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext of searching for items washed ashore and finding something hidden in the sand strongly suggests a natural object like a tree trunk, making meaning 1 (a segment of a tree) plausible.  \n• The mention of \"rings on it\" and its age (more than 200 years) directly supports the interpretation of a tree log, as tree rings are a well-known feature of logs.  \n• Meaning 2 (a ship's log) is implausible because there is no mention of a vessel, voyage, or maritime activity, and the ending does not reference navigation or records.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 1"
