  "raw_response": "system\nYou are an expert linguist specializing in lexical semantics and word sense disambiguation.\nuser\nYou are an expert linguist analyzing whether a homonym (word with multiple meanings) has a CLEAR or AMBIGUOUS meaning in a given context.\n\nHOMONYM: fallout\n\nPOSSIBLE MEANINGS:\n1. the radioactive particles that settle to the ground after a nuclear explosion (e.g., \"The fallout from the explosion contaminated nearby soil.\")\n2. any adverse and unwanted secondary effect (e.g., \"The scandal had significant financial fallout.\")\n\nCONTEXT:\nPrecontext: Jack was nervous when he heard the sirens. The meeting at the facility hadn't gone as planned. People looked worried as they filed out of the room.\nSentence containing the homonym: There was a lot of fallout from the whole situation.\nEnding: The crowds of people looked upset and unsettled.\n\nTASK:\n1. First, provide exactly 3 SHORT bullet points (one line each) analyzing the plausibility of each meaning given the context.\n2. Then, on a new line, output your judgment:\n   - \"JUDGMENT: CLEAR - [meaning number]\" if ONE meaning is highly plausible and the OTHER has low plausibility\n   - \"JUDGMENT: AMBIGUOUS\" if BOTH meanings are plausible OR both have similar plausibility levels\n\nCLEAR = one meaning fits well, the other does not\nAMBIGUOUS = both meanings could work, or neither clearly dominates\n\nConsider:\n- Does the precontext make one meaning much more likely than the other?\n- Does the sentence usage strongly favor one interpretation?\n- Does the ending confirm one meaning while ruling out the other?\n\nFormat your response EXACTLY as:\n• [bullet point 1]\n• [bullet point 2]\n• [bullet point 3]\nJUDGMENT: [CLEAR - N or AMBIGUOUS]\n\nassistant\n• The precontext describes a failed meeting and worried people, suggesting a negative consequence, which aligns well with \"fallout\" as adverse effects.  \n• The phrase \"fallout from the whole situation\" fits naturally as a metaphor for unintended negative consequences, not radioactive material.  \n• Radioactive fallout is not supported by the context—there is no mention of nuclear explosions, radiation, or a facility involving nuclear activity.  \n\nJUDGMENT: CLEAR - 2"
