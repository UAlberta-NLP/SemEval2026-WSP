# Execution Guide for SemEval Project

This document outlines the steps required to run and reproduce the code for our project. All code is contained within Colab Notebooks.

> **Important Note regarding Environment:**
> It is highly recommended to upload these notebooks to **Google Colab** and run them from there, as the code assumes a connection to Google Drive.
>
> If you choose to run this locally, significant adjustments to file paths will be required.

## 1. GlossBert & WSD Setup (`GlossBertWSD.ipynb`)

This notebook contains the code for setting up GlossBert and training a regressor using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).

**Instructions:**
1.  **Upload:** Upload `GlossBertWSD.ipynb` to Google Colab.
2.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure the following files are placed in the directory required by the notebook cells:
    * `train.json`
    * `dev.json`
    * `dev_solution.jsonl`
    * Official scoring scripts
3.  **Execution:** Run the notebook cells sequentially (from first to last).

**Note:** If files are not in the correct directory, please check the error messages to adjust the paths accordingly. This notebook generates the prediction file `dev_predictions_ridge_fixed.jsonl`.

## 2. SemEval Analysis (`FinalSemEval.ipynb`)

This notebook verifies results for every method implemented (excluding the WSD method handled in the previous notebook).

**Instructions:**
1.  **Upload:** Upload `FinalSemEval.ipynb` to Google Colab.
2.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure the following files are placed in the directory:
    * `train.json`
    * `dev.json`
    * `dev_predictions_ridge_fixed.jsonl` (Required for ensemble; generated by the previous notebook)
    * Official scoring scripts
3.  **Execution:** Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the results.

## 3. Project Directory (`SemEvalProject`)

The `SemEvalProject` folder contains all produced files, scores, predictions, and output files.

**Key contents include:**
* **Output Files:** All outputs generated from `FinalSemEval.ipynb`.
* **Annotation:** `dev-synsets-fa-ANNOTATED.tsv` (Our annotation file).
* **Predictions:** `dev_predictions_ridge_fixed.jsonl` (Generated using `GlossBertWSD.ipynb`).
